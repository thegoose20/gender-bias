Geoffrey McKay Gibbon was born in Scarborough on 16 July 1896. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and obtained the degrees of M.B., Ch.B. in 1920. He was registered in Scotland on 8 July 1920. In the 1920s he was living in Elgin and Forres in Scotland, but in the early 1930s he was in Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire, England. It was at this point in his career that when requested by the Registrar of the General Medical Council (Scottish Branch) for notification of any changes to his qualifications, Gibbon's wife informed the Registrar that in September 1931 her husband 'was appointed Surgeon to the R.R.S. 'Discovery II' ' and that he would be absent from the UK for 2-years. The Royal Research Ship 'Discovery II', which had been built in 1929, had sailed from London with Gibbon on board on 3 October 1931 on its second Antarctic commission. The purpose of the expedition was research into the economic resources of the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies in the southern ocean, and more particularly into the most important of these resources at the time: the whale populations and the whaling industry of the waters of the latter, and beyond. The ship had been under the command of Lieut. A. L. Nelson R.N.R. and Comdr. W. M. Carey R.N. (retired), and surveyed from the Magellan Strait to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and then in the oceans around South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. By 1934 Gibbon was working for the Cyprus Medical Service, and in the 1940s he was with the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda. In 1954, the Medical register indicated that he was residing in the Port Elizabeth area of South Africa. Latterly, in the early-1960s (1962), Gibbon lived in Lympstone, Devon. His name ceased to appear in the Medical register after 1983.

The Scottish writer and poet Violet Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine on 1 September 1863 in Angus. The Kennedy-Erskine family owned the Dun estate near Montrose. She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944).  On 3 July 1936, Violet Jacob, authoress, was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Edinburgh. She was noted as a 'writer and poet' in the University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 8. 1936-1937., p34. Latterly Violet Jacob had lived in Kirriemuir, Angus, and she died on 9 September 1946.

Alexander Crum Brown was born on 26 March 1838. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Mill Hill School, and he studied at the Universities of Edinburgh, Heidleberg and Marburg. He was an extra-academical Lecturer in Chemistry at the University, 1863-1869. Professor Crum Brown, as he was known, was one of the greatest holders of the University of Edinburgh's Chair of Chemistry, from 1869. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although kindly and popular he struggled to keep control of some rather riotous classes. He retired in 1908. Crum Brown was President of the Chemical Society of London, 1893-1893. Professor Alexander Crum Brown died on 28 October 1922. George Burns obtained a B.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1896.

Alicia Ann Spottiswoode (Alicia Scott) was born at Spottiswoode House in the Borders (formerly Berwickshire) on 24 June 1810. She was a Scottish songwriter and composer known chiefly for the tune, Annie Laurie, to which the words of a 17th-century poet, William Douglas, were set. She was the oldest daughter of John Spottiswoode of Berwickshire and his wife Helen Wauchope of Niddrie-Mains. On 16 March 1836 she married Lord John Douglas Scott, a younger son of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, and consequently is alternatively known by her courtesy title of Lady John Scott.

Margaret Winifred Bartholomew was born on 21 August 1885 at Duntarvie, West Lothian, just over a dozen miles west of Edinburgh. She was the third of the five children of John and Agnes Bartholomew. Her father was a farmer and her mother a musician. She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies College between 1895 and 1903, and then she studied at the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, 1903-1908, graduating with the degrees of M.B. and Ch.B. from Edinburgh University, 1908. Her aunt, Dr. Isabella Mears, a missionary in China, was one of the first ten women to become a doctor in Britain. From 1908, and for a year, Bartholomew worked as an Assistant in General Practice, and then in 1909 she gained a post as a Medical Missionary in the Womens Hospital, Nagpur, India where she carried out surgical work and midwifery. In 1914, she returned to Scotland, and on the outbreak of war took over her brother's medical practice near Edinburgh. In 1915 however, in November, she had returned to India, and in Bombay married Frank Rushworth who was at that time a Captain in the 7th Rajputs, an Indian Regiment stationed in the North West Frontier. By the end of the year though, Rushforth had been sent to Mesopotamia. In 1916, Winifred was working in the Mission Hospital, Jalna, in central India, doing surgical work and inoculations against bubonic plague and cholera. In 1917, her husband returned to India to a government post in Simla, and she did surgical work in a womens hospital there. In 1920 they moved to Calcutta, where Frank worked in business and Winifred was a volunteer worker organising infant welfare work and started child guidance with mothers groups. For this work, Rushforth received the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal (Emperor of India Medal). In 1929, in London, she underwent training at the Tavistock Clinic beginning a personal analysis and carrying out analytic treatment of patients. By 1931, the Depression had ended her husband's career in Calcutta and so the family settled in Edinburgh where he worked as Registrar at the Edinburgh College of Art. Rushforth continued with personal analysis and in 1933 began work as an analytical psycho-therapist in private practice in Edinburgh - at this time, very much pioneer work in Scotland. In 1939, just as the War started, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was joined by Dr. Elspeth Macleod - a child therapist - and several of her own patients who had teaching and other qualifications, and opened a small clinic with the support of a Presbyterian congregation. This was the Davidson Clinic. Her confidence in analytic psycho-therapy was strengthened by the arrival in Scotland of Jewish refugee psychiatrists from Germany, and one of them, Dr. William Kraemer, joined her in 1941 and they worked together for sixteen years establishing the Davidson Clinic. During the wartime years, and after, the Clinic flourished, and as other doctors and clinicians associated themselves with it, psycho-therapists were able to be trained. As far as patients were concerned - and as concerned the analytical work - at one time as many as 100 patients were being treated daily. Then, with the passing of the Mental Health Act (1959), and the re-organisation of the mental hospitals across the UK, the treatment of neurosis and psycho-therapy was taken over by the State and new era of treatment began using barbiturate drugs and tranquillisers. Unable to offer comparable salaries to those offered by the National Health Service (NHS) it became impossible to recruit psychiatric staff, and so the Davidson Clinic was not able to survive. From its inception in 1939 and until 1965, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was the Honorary Medical Director of the Davidson Clinic. On the death of her successor, she returned to the Clinic to wind up its affairs. Then, in 1967, Rushforth was awarded the OBE in recognition for her work. From 1965 until her death she continued her private practice in psycho-therapy working both with individual patients and also with Dream-Growth groups. In addition, Easter and Summer schools were held after 1965 and out of these the Sempervivum Trust emerged. Rushforth also provided inspiration to the work of the Salisbury Centre, Edinburgh (1973), and of Wellspring, Edinburgh (1978). In 1981, at the age of ninety-five, she published Something is happening: spiritual awareness and depth psychology in the new age. It was first published in London by the Turnstone Press. Another work was Ten decades of happenings (1984), which was an autobiography. After her death, Life's Currency: Time, Money and Energy: An Anthology of Shorter Writings (1986) was published. Dr. Winifred Rushforth died at her home in Edinburgh on 29 August 1983. Sir Laurens van der Post attended Dr Rushforth's Memorial Service in Old St Paul's Church, Edinburgh, as Prince Charles's representative. Earlier that year, the Prince and Princess of Wales had visited her in her home.

The study is concerned with 'one of the earliest known historical accounts of Acadian Deportation' which was written by the Rev. Dr. Andrew Brown in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Brown's manuscript was entitled Removal of the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia by Lieut. Governor Lawrence and His Majesty's Council in October 1755. The primary purpose of the study was to provide an annotated edition of the manuscript, but it also takes a broader look at Brown. The external thesis was written by Sara J. Beanlands of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was submitted to Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in September 2010.

The divine and poet Ralph Erskine was born on 15 March 1685 at Monilaws in Northumberland. He was the sixth son of the Rev. Henry Erskine (1624-1696) by his second wife Margaret Halcro. Henry Erskine had settled in Northumberland in 1684 after a period of imprisonment on the Bass Rock. Ralph Erskine entered Edinburgh University in November 1699 studying an Arts course until 1704. Strongly religious as a child and influenced in young adulthood by the religious conversion of his sister-in-law who had married his brother Ebenezer Erskine (1680-1754), he himself became converted. After University he became tutor to the family of Colonel John Erskine of Culross, and he also pursued theological studies. In 1709 he was licensed by the Dunfermline Presbytery and was ordained in 1711. After a dispute with General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1732, Erskine along with six other ministers formed the Scottish Secession Church with Ebenezer Erskine as their first Moderator. In the late-1730s correspondence was begun between Erskine and George Whitefield (1714-1770) the Anglican cleric and evangelist who had gone to North America. The correspondence led to Whitefield coming to Scotland and his first sermon in Scotland was delivered at Erskine's own church. It wasn't too long before Erskine's Secession Church was torn in two - over the taking of the Civil Oath by Burgesses in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth. The argument was over what was meant in taking that Oath and over what it meant by promising to oppose Catholicism. Those who opposed the Oath withdrew in 1747 and constituted themselves as the General Associate Synod. Ralph Erskine is responsible for the following works: Gospel sonnets published early in his ministry and reaching a 10th edition in 1762 and a 25th in 1797 long after his death; a paraphrase of the Song of Solomon (1738); a version of the Book of Lamentations (1750). Job's hymns was published posthumously in in 1753. His Practical works in two volumes were edited by John Newlands, his son-in-law in 1764-1766. In the 1750s, Erskine developed heart disease and his last sermon was held in late-October 1752. Ralph Erskine died on 6 November 1752, and he was buried in Dunfermline on 9 November.

Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English, University College Swansea. During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military communication Enigma codes. After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics.A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English, or LALME, was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist methodology in the study of the linguistic history. McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and this resulted in the publication in 1952 of hisIntroduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. In the same year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a tireless supporter of both theScottish National Dictionaryand theDictionary of the Older Scottish Tongueor DOST. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh University, both founded by McIntosh, merged.

Marie Laurencin was born in Paris on 31 October 1883. She attended the Lycee Lamartine in the city before studying porcelain painting at the Sevres factory. Later on she entered the Academie Humbert. In 1907 she exhibited at the Clovis Sagot gallery in Montmartre, and there she was introduced to Guillaume Apollinaire by Pablo Picasso and she became romatically involved with Apollinaire until 1913. In 1908, Laurencin achieved her first sale when Gertrude Stein purchasedGroup of artists. This group portrait of Laurencin, Apollinaire, and Picasso and his mistress became the theme of a larger version in 1909 entitledApollinaire and his friends. In 1911 she exhibited in the Salon des Independants, and she began illustrating books. The ending of her relationship with Apollinaire in 1913 also saw the end of her Cubist-inspired period. In 1913, Laurencin established a contract with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg which would last until 1940, and in 1914 she married the German Baron, Otto von Waetjen. On the outbreak of war however they fled to Spain and spent time in Madrid and Barcelona, and then also to Germany. In 1921 she returned to Paris and in the same year she divorced von Waetjen. The early-1920s saw Laurencin designing sets and costumes most notably for the Ballets Russes -Les Biches- as well as painting society portraits including that of Coco Chanel. In the 1930s she was teaching at the art academy, Villa Malakoff. In 1942 she publishedLe Carnet des nuits. In 1944, her apartment on Rue Savorgnan de Brazza was requisitioned by the Germans and she did not get it back until 1953. Marie Laurencin died in Paris on 8 June 1956 and she was buried in the cemetary Pere Lachaise.

Edward Adrian Wilson (Wilson of the Antarctic) was born in Cheltenham on 23 July 1872. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and at St. George's Hospital, London. Dr. Wilson was an accomplished self-taught artist and field naturalist. Although he had contracted tuberculosis during his work in the slums of London, he was appointed as the Assistant Surgeon and Vertebrate Zoologist to the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-1904) aboard 'Discovery', under Commander Robert Falcon Scott (1868-1912). On the return of the Expedition he was appointed Field Observer to the Grouse Disease Inquiry. He also illustrated wildlife books. In 1910 Wilson returned to the Antarctic with Captain Scott aboard the vessel 'Terra Nova' as Chief of the Scientific Staff. The Expedition reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, but only after the Norwegian Expedition under Roald Amundsen had gotten there first. Edward Adrian Wilson BA, MB (Cantab.), FZS died on the Great Ice Barrier around 29 March 1912 along with his fellow explorers on the return journey from the Pole.

In 1940, Auerbach began work on the effect of mustard gas on gene mutation, together with Pio Koller. The work was initially suggested by A.J. Clark of the Pharmacology Department at the University of Edinburgh, who had a contract with the Chemical Defence Establishment of the War Office to study the biological effects of mustard gas. Auerbach and Koller teamed up with Clark and J.M. Robson in Pharmacology to expose Drosophila flies to mustard gas. Striking results were obtained almost immediately, and by 1942 they could show conclusively that mustard gas was mutagenic. Due to the confidential nature of the work, the findings were not published until 1946 in a series of joint papers by Auerbach and Robson. Auerbach received the prestigious Keith Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, but the credit she was to receive for the work caused great annoyance to Robson, despite Auerbach's assertion that the Prize should have been awarded jointly.

Annie T. Altschul - an Austrian by birth - arrived in Britain with her mother in 1938, after the Anschluss. The Altschuls were a Jewish family. She trained as a nurse in London in the 1940s, and although qualifying as a general nurse and as a midwife, she found her niche in psychiatric nursing. After training at Mill Hill Emergency Hospital she moved to the merged Bethlem and Maudsley Hospitals and, while progressing from staff nurse to sister to Principal tutor, she also took a first class honours degree in Psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London. In 1964 she was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Nursing Studies at Edinburgh University. She then became a Senior Lecturer before being appointed to the Chair of Nursing Studies in 1976-77. Her publications includePsychiatric Nursing(1957), andPsychology for Nurses(1962). Altschul retired from the University in 1983, and on her retirement she was awarded the CBE and given the status of Professor Emeritus of Nursing Studies. Annie T. Altschul died on 24 December 2001.

Charlotte Auerbach arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1933 after being forced to flee Germany and the anti-Semitic laws in place there at the time. Auerbach became best known for her 1941 discovery with J.M. Robson that mustard gas causes mutagenesis. This material was likely gathered together as part of Beale's preparation of his biographical memoir of Auerbach which was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).

Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959.

Nuria Quevedo lives in Berlin, Germany, but was born in 1938 in Barcelona, Catalonia. Her family had emigrated to East Berlin in 1952. From 1958 to 1963 she studied at the Art School (Hochschule fuer bildende und angewandte Kunst) in Berlin-Weissensee, and then began working freelance in 1963. Between 1968 and 1971 she was a student at the Academy of Arts (Akademie der Kuenste) in the former German Democratic Republic (DDR), obtaining a master's degree there, and then from 1986 until 1991 she was a member of the Academy. From 1994 to 1996 she held a Professorship at Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald (the Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. From 1965, Quevedo exhibited widely in Germany (in Berlin, Chemnitz, Schwerin, Rostock, and Wittenberg) and in 1971 she held an exhibition in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Carnegie Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training opened in Dunfermline on the 4th October 1905. The Andrew Carnegie Trust founded it as a training college for women students of Physical Education. In 1908 the college was opened to men and in 1909 it was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as a central institution for the purpose of the Education (Scotland) Act 1908. Between 1913-14 new accommodation were built, and the college was renamed Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Education (DCHPE). From 1931 only women students were trained at DCHPE - the male students being transferred to Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow. Between 1939-46 the staff and students of the college were temporarily transferred to the Teachers Training Centre in Aberdeen, its buildings being commandeered by the navy during World War II. In 1950 the College transferred to Woolmanhill, Aberdeen, due to over-crowding problems at the other site. Hygiene was then dropped from the name of the college and the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust severed connections since the College was no longer based in Dunfermline. A Board of Governors was established for the College in 1959, and in 1966 the College (now just DCPE) transferred to newly built specialist accommodation at Cramond, Edinburgh. In 1986 it was announced that the training of physical education teachers - male and female - would be centralised at Cramond. In 1987 DCPE merged with Moray House College of Education and the male students then at Jordanhill College transferred to the enlarged Moray House at the same time. The combined expertise provided the core of the Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies (SCOPEMALS) at Moray House, Cramond Campus. In 1998 Moray House Institute of Education together with its Cramond Campus became the Faculty of Education of the University of Edinburgh. The University closed the Cramond Campus over the summer of 2001 and the students, staff and facilities relocated to the refurbished St Leonard's Land at Holyrood, part of The Moray House School of Education of the University. During the period at Cramond, one of the students there in the late-1960s was Diana Kerr Hastings.  Diana Kerr Hastings was born in Argyll in 1949, and moved to Angus aged 6. Between 1967 and 1970 she studied at Dunfermline College of Physical Education (DCPE), Cramond. This was at a time when students were expected to take up in-house accommodation in their 1st year, could take approved lodgings in their 2nd year, and had the choice of being resident or non-resident (being 'in' or 'out') in their 3rd year . Some students too began to flat-share, but this had to be with other DCPE students and even then, as Mrs Hastings has noted 'even those pioneers of indepndent living were told they would not be allowed into sick bay if they were ill'. During her three year course she represented the College in athletics, badminton, lacrosse, netball and orienteering. She was also the College netball secretary and she went on to serve as Liaison Officer for Scottish Netball when they played their Home International matches at Meadowbank, Edinburgh, in the 1970s. In 1970, she graduated from DCPE with the Diploma of Physical Education, with Merit in Professional Subjects. Between 1970 and 1972 she taught in Kirriemuir, Angus, and later on moved back to Edinburgh and taught at St. Giles School for the Hearing Impaired until 1976. From 1992 she retrained in Paediatric Audiology working initially in Lothian Region schools, and then for the NHS until her retirement in June 2009. In 2010, Diana Kerr Hastings attended a 40th Anniversary gathering of graduating students (from the 1967-1970 course).

Until the mid-19th century, broadsides provided the sort of information provided by modern tabloids. They tended to be single sheets of paper, unfolded, and printed on one side. Designed to be posted up in public places, broadsides were used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices, and later on became a means of political agitation. Edinburgh's 'baillies', the officials responsible for this notice or broadside, were the city's magistrates who had administrative and judicial powers. In Scotland the office of 'baillie', also spelled 'bailie', emerged in the 14th century. Since 1975, the title has largely become a courtesy one. Those baillies present when this ordinance was issued in Edinburgh in November 1720 were: John Wightman, George Preston, Robert Grierson, and Hugh Hathorn. They were present as Baillies and Justices of His Majesty's Peace. The ordinance was intended to restrain the soldiers of the City Guard from the 'immoral practices of Cursing and Swearing'. Those who were caught would be fined one penny and the money put into the poor box.

William White Anderson was born on 17 March 1888. He was educated at Bo'ness Academy, and then he studied at Glasgow University. Anderson became a missioner in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1912, and during the 1914-1918 War he was a Chaplain to the Forces. He was Senior Chaplain (9th Division), served with the army of occupation in Germany, and was Senior Chaplain in the Lowland Division. He received the M.C. in 1917. He was Minister of Bellahouston Parish Church, 1919-1926, Minister of New Kilpatrick Parish, Bearsden, 1926-1931, and then from 1931 was the Junior then Senior Minister of St. Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh, and he was Chaplain too in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, 1926. During the 1939-1945 War he served with the Royal Navy and he was awarded the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Officers' Decoration. In 1951, Anderson was appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and in 1952 became Chaplain to the Queen in Scotland. Earlier he had been Chaplain to King George VI in Scotland, 1949-1952. The Very Rev. William White Anderson died 17 December 1956.

The mineralogist Robert Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774. His early education was received in Leith and then he became the apprentice of a surgeon in Leith, with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at Edinburgh University, studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. On the death of John Walker in 1803, Jameson was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Keeper of the University Museum. He died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1854.  William Danset was born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, in 1792, and matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1810. He was elected a Stapledon scholar of his college in 1811, but resigned the following year. He gained B.A. 1814, M.A. 1817, and Med. Bac. 1818. Ordained in 1819, he was nominated to the rectory of Donhead St. Andrew, Wiltshire, in 1820, and remained until his death in1856.

William Stewart Watson was born in 1800 and died in Edinburgh in 1870. Watson is said to have practised for some years in America, but he was in Rome in 1840 and in London between 1843 and 1847, after which he settled in Edinburgh where he remained for the rest of his life. The artist's favourite subjects were portraits and history paintings. In addition to painting, Stewart Watson often used other techniques and materials such as ink, watercolour, chalk and charcoal. He is also known as a miniature painter. His pictures Joseph Grant, WS, Seated at a Desk , George Gordon, 6th Lord Byron (1823), Don Quixote Tilting at a Windmill  (before 1832), Holyrood Dairy, Edinburgh (c. 1840), and The Inauguration of Robert Burns as Poet Laureate of the Lodge (1846) are in the Signet Library, Edinburgh City Art Collection, and the National Galleries of Scotland.

The James Tait Black Memorial Prize was established by the will of Janet Coats (1844-1918), daughter of Thomas Coats, the Glasgow cotton manufacturer, in memory of her late husband, James Tait Black, whom she had married in 1884. James Tait Black (1826-1911) was son of Adam Black the Edinburgh publisher. Two prizes were to be awarded a year, one for fiction and one for biography. Robert Welsh (1874-1960), Janet Coats/Black's solicitor in Ayr, was the formal administrator; the sole judge was to be the Professor of English Literature at Edinburgh University. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson (1866-1960) was Professor of English Literature at the University of Edinburgh between 1915 and 1935.

The 'Donaldson report' was a report from an expert group established by the government and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson. The group was asked to undertake an assessment of the anticipated benefits of new areas of research using human embryos, the risks and alternatives, and ultimately, to advise whether these new areas of research should be permitted. The report, 'Stem Cell Research: medical progress with responsibility', was published by the Department of Health in June 2000. The report concluded that research was warranted across a range of sources of stem cells, and that it did not raise any new ethical issues different from those already raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research. The report was followed by a response from the government in August 2000, which accepted all the report's recommendations and undertook to introduce regulations to extend the permitted research purposes under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and to set out unequivocally in legislation the existing ban on reproductive cloning.

Probably the earliest documented use of an instrument which we today might regard as a passport is an item mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah. During the reign of the ancient Persian ruler Artaxerxes (around 450 BC), the prophet Nehemiah, who was working as a royal cup-bearer but who wished to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, was granted letters from the king requesting the governors of the lands beyond the Euphrates to grant him safe passage to Judah. Closer to our own time and place, in Britain one of the earliest documents to which we can refer as a 'safe conduct' document appeared during the reign of King Henry V of England in an Act of the English Parliament dated 1414. In those days, such a document could be issued by the king to anyone, whether English or not. Later on, from 1540, it became the job of the Privy Council to grant travelling papers and from this point onwards the expression 'passport' began to be used though whether or not it was derived from the notion of travellers passing through seaports ('passer', to pass, and 'port', meaning port or harbour) or through gates in city walls is open to debate. One document issued in June 1641 and signed by King Charles I still exists. Late in the 18th century, the office of the Secretary of State took charge of issuing passports, and it is the Home Office that retains it today. From this time on - from around 1794 - records remain of every British passport which had been granted. They continued to be available to foreign nationals too, and until 1858 they were written in French. After that date, the passport acquired its role as a British identity document. Even so, passports were not generally required for international travel until the First World War. In 1914, and as a result of the British Nationality and Status Aliens Act, the first modern British passport was used. As a result of agreement on the standardisation of passports reached between the member states of the League of Nations, a 'blue' coloured passport still recognised by many today was issued in 1920 and that format served until 1988 and gradual replacement by the 'burgundy' coloured European version in 1988. The letters of safe conduct in this small collection are believed to have been intended for use in the Caucasus, perhaps in Daghestan where the only written language in the nineteenth century was Arabic.

Eric Olof Lundholm was born in 1915 in Modderfontein, in the Transvaal, South Africa. His parents were Goesta Lundholm, a chemist, and Dr. Agnes Barr Auchencloss. His great-grandfather, Olof Lundholm, was personal attendant to Carl XIV Johan, King of Sweden. As Master of the Household he served the Swedish Court for 68 years and throughout the reigns of four Swedish monarchs, and was awarded the Vasa Order in 1864. Lundholm's grandfather, Carl Olof Lundholm, a noted engineer, was an associate of Alfred Nobel who asked him to manage his new fulminate of mercury plant at Westquarter, near Falkirk, in Scotland, and was then appointed Manager of Nobel's Explosive Company at Ardeer, near Stevenston. Goesta Lundholm, earlier a chemist with the British South African Explosive Co. Ltd. became Superintendent at the ICI Detonator Factory at Westquarter. The young Eric Olof Lundholm received his early education in Modderfontein, and then with the family's move to Scotland, his secondary education was provided at Falkirk High School. Glasgow University followed, and in 1937 he graduated B.Sc. First Class Honours in Geology, and became Baxter Demonstrator in Geology. In 1939 he enrolled at Glasgow Medical School but after the outbreak of war he was called up in August 1940 into a chemical warfare training battalion, Royal Engineers. He was commissioned in June 1941 and posted to a Boring Unit R.E., and saw service in the Middle East, first unblocking oil wells at Kirkuk, cemented by the Allies against possible German advance, thereafter on water supply development by bore-holes. On demobilisation in February 1946, Lundholm resumed his medical course, graduating M.B. Ch.B. at Glasgow University in July 1950. One year as House Surgeon and House Physician was followed by specialising in Psychiatry, and he took the Diploma in Psychological Medicine (DPM) of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ireland in 1953. In April 1960, Eric Olof Lundholm married Dorothy Vida Henning, B.A. M.Sc. (Geography, Trinity College, Dublin) who was an Assistant Lecturer in Geography at Glasgow University and subsequently became a Medical Artist, working in the Anatomy Department, illustrating professorial writings. Dr. Eric Olof Lundholm retired in July 1980 after working in psychiatric hospitals in West and East Scotland with special interests in therapeutic communities, individual and group psychotherapy and psychogeriatric medicine. He lives in Edinburgh.

James Griffith Macaskie was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed on 1 December 1856. He was the third son of George Macaskie. James attended Berwick Grammar School and then went to Edinburgh to study at the School of Medicine, Surgeon's Hall. He lived with his uncle, Dr. J. Cochran, and he assisted at the Apothecary of a relative in the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. He was awarded a Bronze Medal for Physiology (Second Prize) while at Surgeon's Hall and was given a set of surgical instruments. He completed his studies at the young age of 21, and became an assistant to Dr. Crompton in Bury, Lancashire, before qualifying in 1878 - Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh) LRCS, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh) LRCP. Macaskie registered in England on 20 September 1878. In 1880, Macaskie became an assistant to Dr. Lewis G. Broadbent MD in Bamburgh, Northumberland, and became a practice partner in 1883. With his prospects secure, he married Marianne Kidd, daughter of a Tynemouth solicitor. In 1890 he took examinations in Edinburgh for the Diploma in Public Health (DPH Glasgow). On the retiral of Dr. Broadbent in 1891, Macaskie took up residence in the Doctor's House (thus also taking on the free Dispensary at Bamburgh Castle supported by the Lord Crewe Charity). During the Great War of 1914-1918, two of Macaskie's sons served with the RMC in Egypt and India, and a third was Commissioned in 1918 and served in France. That son died in 1924 due to ill-health acquired during the War. Macaskie retired in 1927 and he moved to Harrogate to be close to a brother. On the death of that brother, he returned To Northumberland, to Seahouses, in 1936. Dr. James Griffiths Macaskie died on 3 January 1945.

In 1967, Beatty and Anne McLaren applied jointly for a contination grant from the Ford Foundation to enable them to continue their work in Gamete Genetics (Beatty) and Reproductive Physiology (Anne McLaren) in the Reproductive Genetics Section. This application proved successful, and in July 1967, a grant of $151,000 was awarded to the University of Edinburgh to Beatty and Anne McLaren for a five year period in continued support of research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction. In 1971 the Ford Foundation suggested that Beatty and McLaren make an application for a second grant renewal before the expiry of the current grant.

Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.

The prolific writer, editor and compiler Josiah Conder was born in Aldersgate, London, on 17 September 1789, the son of a map engraver and bookseller, Thomas Conder. At the age of ten his first essay was published in The Monthly Preceptor, and on reaching thirteen, he began work as an assistant in the family's City bookshop. In 1811, at the age of twenty-one, he took it over. Shortly afterwards, Josiah married Joan Elizabeth Thomas (Eliza Thomas). He had initially formed a literary association with her in 1810 to jointly contribute to the book The associate minstrels. Josiah Conder was a close friend of the engraver and educationalist Isaac Taylor (1759-1829) and his wife, and Conder addressed poems to them both, having been a regular visitor to their home. Another of Conder's earlier works was The withered oak (1806), otherwise The reverie (1811), The star in the east (1824), A dictionary of geography (1834), The epistle to the Hebrews, a new translation, with notes (1834), The congregational hymnbook (1834), The literary history of the New testament (1845) and The harmony of history with prophecy, an explanation of the Apocalypse (1849) are among the publications of which he was author, editor or compiler. Josiah Conder's political work included a tract on the superior value of free labour over slave labour, Wages or the Whip (1833). Josiah Conder died on 27 December 1855, at St John's Wood, Hampstead, following an attack of jaundice, and was buried at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington. His literary wife Joan, died aged 91 in 1877 and was buried with him.

Within this collection of 65 Scottish charters and documents in Early Scots and Latin, there is a small part which was probably the remnant of an archive of the Burgesses of Perth. This remnant of fifteenth century material is said to have been held together since 1911 at least, when they were leant by J. A. Beattie to the 1911 Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry in the Palace of History (Kelvingrove Park), Glasgow. The items in question are noted below (in Scope and Content, nos: 1-3), and are: a charter between Abbot Alexander of Scone and Lady Catherine Paxton; a grant of land from Robert Logy (perhaps Logie), Burgess of Perth; and, a charter from Alexander Seres (perhaps Ceres), Burgess of Perth, to John Mirtone, Canon of Dunkeld.It is through the study of legal documents like these that our knowledge of Early Scots can be greatly added to, for it has been said that the literary (as opposed to the legal) record of the Scots language was 'very late in beginning'. Indeed with the 'exception of one or two fragments of verse, there is nothing that can be definitely set down as earlier than the Bruce of John Barbour' in or around 1375. If literature had been the only source open for researchers, there would have been almost no material available for the study of Scots prior to 1375 (see W.A. Craigie, 'The earliest records of the Scottish tongue', Scottish Historical Review. Vol.22, No.85. October 1924, pp.61-67). The legal documents that form this collection were created within three decades of that early work of literature.

William Baird possibly had an association with Dysart in Fife, Scotland, in the seventeenth century. Within the manuscript, in its first part, there are a number of clues that supply a date to his life and indicate the Scottish origin of the item. Under an explanation of the Dominical Letter system for discovering the day of the week corresponding to any date is included a mnemonic beginning, 'At Dysart dwells George Bronn Esquire'. The inclusion of this mnemonic suggests that Baird was engaged in teaching mathematics to others and that he was doing so in Scotland. In addition to the reference to Dysart, there is also mention of Scottish money - 'Lib Scotts' - and a date of 1676 is supplied in another calculation. Dysart is a small town on the River Forth, on the northern shore of its large estuary. Dating from the 13th century, the town established itself in the middle of the 15th century as a trading port, exporting salt and coal to the Low Countries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. It had been towards the end of the 16th century that the first coal pit in the town was sunk - known as Lady Blanche. By the middle of the 17th century when coal began to surpass the salt trade, two new pits followed - Frances and Randolph. Two hundred years later, in 2009, there was no coal trade and no salt trade, and the community was a suburb of Kirkcaldy.

John Baillie served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1943-1944. The Church and Nation Committee was set up in 1919, by the Church of Scotland, to review its relationship to the national life of the country. It set up the more specific Commission for the Interpretation of God's Will in the Present Crisis at the General Assembly of 1940. Its role was, 'to seek reverently to guide the Church in the interpretation of the Holy Will and Purpose of God in present-day events, and to examine how the testimony of the Church to the Gospel may become more effective in our own land, overseas and in the international order'.

These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory. At this time Beale was studying the change from serotype D to serotype B of stock 51 (variant 4). The cells were treated with an immunising and potentially lethal solution containing anti-D antibodies, which lead to the cells becoming 'resistant' to the immunising action. Tracy Sonneborn had previously shown that the 'sensitive' and 'resistant' types of cell were 'hereditary'. Beale demonstrated that this change involved a replacement of the initial antigen (D) by another one (B) which could take place in every cell which was treated, and that for an intermediate period, both antigens could be detected in a single cell. Beale published a paper on the subject in 1948 entitled 'The process of transformation of antigenic type in Paramecium' which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA (34, 418-423).

Russell A. Leather was born in 1924. He was educated at George Heriot's School and studied at Edinburgh University from 1948. His university education was delayed by wartime and his army service as a Captain in the Far East with the Royal Corps of Signals, 1942-1947/48. As in other instutions in the UK, studying at Edinburgh University in the immediate post-war period was challenging. Food and clothing were severely rationed and new equipment was in short supply. Test equipment and other mechanical machinery were of pre-war standard, but although out-dated it was capable of producing decent results. Although Leather studied electrical engineering, the first year curriculum was aimed at providing students with a broader engineering background. Mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology were all covered.  In the pre-war period, the emphasis had been on civil engineering but this changed in the late-1940s when, under Professor Arnold, greater emphasis was placed on mechanical engineering. And, later on, under Professor Farvis, an electrical engineering curriculum was developed and this included electronics which, though still hollow state, would soon be dominated by solid state electronics. At Edinburgh University, electrical power engineering relied on equipment at the then Heriot-Watt College. After his studies, Leather worked on and researched into radar with Ferranti in Edinburgh and in Dundee. During his time with Ferranti he took out around 25 patents. Latterly he was Chair of the Gannochy Trust for seventeen years until 2008, and had been a Trustee for 40-years. Russell A. Leather BSc Hon LL.D. CEng. FIEE MIMechE visited Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections, in November 2012 to donate his first and second year engineering note-books.

The ornamental turner Charles Holtzapffel was born in 1806. He was the son of the German engineer John Jacob Holtzapffel (1768-1835), from Alsace, who had settled in London in the 1780s and who had founded the tool business in the 1790s. Trading as John Holtzapffel in London's Long Acre, the firm was noted for its production of iron-bedded lathes with ornamental turning apparatus. In 1804 the firm was expanded to include John George Deyerlein but this arrangement lasted only until 1827. In 1827, Charles Holtzapffel joined the firm at the age of 21. The younger Holtzapffel had received a good English education, and through careful training in the firm's workshop he had become a skilled engineer in his own right. On the death of his father, Charles carried on the firm and continued to develop the machinery and attachments for ornamental turnery. Other devices were invented too, including machinery for printing banknotes, a dividing engine for the graduation of drawing scales, and an apparatus for tracing geometrical figures on glass. In 1838, Charles published hisNew system of scales of equal parts applicable to various purposes of engineering, architecture and general sciencefollowed by its complement, theList of scales of equal parts. In 1843, he publishedTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 1: Materials, their choice, preparation and various modes of working them. This was actually his father's work and was followed in 1846 by his ownTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 2: Construction, action, and application of cutting tools. By 1884, five volumes of this turner's bible had been published by Charles and his son John Jacob Holtzapffel II. Charles Holtzapffel was a member of the Council of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was Chairman of the Mechanic's Committee of the Society of Arts. He died on 11 April 1847 and his widow Amelia Vaux (Dutton) Holtzapffel managed the firm until 1853. Their son John Jacob became head of the firm in 1867 and managed the business until 1896 when Charles' nephew George William Budd (later known as George William Holtzapffel) took over. John Jacob Holtzapffel II died in Eastbourne on 14 October 1897. In 1919, Colonel John George Holtzapffel Budd, the son of George William Holtzapffel, began to take an active part in running the firm.

History of Art (formerly the Department of Fine Art) is a popular and long-established department of Edinburgh University. It has the oldest full-time Chair of Art History in Britain which was founded in 1880. History of Art is located at Minto House, 20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, opposite the Royal Museum of Scotland, and within easy walking distance of most of the galleries and museums of central Edinburgh. History of Art has book, slide and photographic collections, as well as a photographic unit. There is also a laboratory for the demonstration of metalworking techniques and methods of conservation. A collection of postcards in photo albums and small file drawers was gathered together by members of Fine Art staff (in the Department's early years) for use as teaching aids before the advent of the popular colour slide format. The early postcard collection is important in that the cards are primarily of European buildings, many of which were lost or damaged during the revolutions and conflicts of the 20th century.

Florence Bruce Dorward was born in Galashiels on 28 August 1912. She was the eldest child of Norman James Dorward and Elizabeth Haig Bruce. Her father, and his brother Adam, ran the family tweed clothing manufacturing firm J. & J. C. Dorward of Galashiels. In October 1925, following the death of her father, Florence was sent as a 'boarder' to St. Trinnean's School, Edinburgh. However, when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1928 she became a 'day-girl' at the school. St. Trinnean's School had been founded in Edinburgh by Miss Catherine Fraser Lee in 1922 and when it opened in October of that year it had just 60 girls as students. It was located in a building at 10 Palmerston Road, just off Grange Road in Edinburgh. Miss Lee practised the Dalton system of education with an emphasis on self-discipline. Later, in 1925, the school moved to St. Leonard's House, off Dalkeith Road in Edinburgh, but the outbreak of the Second World War then forced the girls and staff to be evacuated to Galashiels, to Gala House. In the 1950s, a series of St Trinian'scomedy films was made, starring Alastair Sim, George Cole, and Joyce Grenfell, and with the school depicted as a quite unorthodox one and where the girls wreaked havoc. Florence left the real St. Trinnean's in summer 1930 and then attended the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy which was located at Atholl Crescent, Edinburgh. In October 1931 she obtained a Housewife's Diploma First Class, and a Cook's Certificate From October 1931 to July 1932 Florence worked as a cook at Canaan Park School in South Oswald Road, Edinburgh, and between October 1933 and August 1935 she worked in Ettrick Road, Edinburgh - probably at a nursing home run by a Miss Eleanor Murdy - and then as a cookery demonstrator with the Southern Scottish Electric Supply Company Ltd., in Galashiels. Later in 1935, and until February 1936, she visited family in South Africa. Over 1938-1939 she was an Assistant Manageress at a Mackie's Buttery. During the war, on 29 June 1940, Florence Bruce Dorward married Thomas Cowan Steven who later became a Chartered Accountant and partner in the firm William Home Cook, Robertson Maxtone Graham, and Thomas McLintock. The couple had a son in 1942, and then a daughter in 1945. In May 1975, Florence gave her war-time wedding outfit, the receipts for it, and trousseau items, to the National Museum of Antiquities, Queen Street, Edinburgh, where it was displayed in the then 'Costume Gallery' a year later. She is also noted as having attended the St. Trinnean's School Reunion which was a 'sit down' buffet luncheon held on Thursday 22 October 1998 at the John McIntyre Centre, Pollock Halls, Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh. A look around the old school building had been planned too. A Reunion had also been held at the same place in 1985. Florence Bruce Steven died on 25 November 2008. She had been pre-deceased by her husband, 10 May 1988. Her old school, St. Trinnean's, had closed its doors in 1946 on the retiral of Miss Lee. St. Leonard's Hall which housed St. Trinnean's between 1925 and the outbreak of war is now within Pollock Halls of Residence, Edinburgh University, and has an administrative, hospitality and conference function. It was built in 1869 by John Lessels (1809-1883) in Baronial style. During the First World War the building was used as a Red Cross Hospital, and during the Second World War it became an Air Raid Precautions and Home Guard Headquarters. St Leonard's became a hall of residence for female students until the completion of the more modern buildings on the Pollock site from the 1960s onwards.

The Englishman Reginald Augustus Warren was born in 1820. In the 1850s, known as 'Squire' Warren, he had purchased a large amount of land and farms in West Sussex, particularly around East Preston. Earlier, between 1844 and 1845 he took a journey to Egypt and travelled by camel from Cairo to Jerusalem.  Reginald Augustus Warren died in 1911.

Elsie Gwenllian Taylor was born in Cardiff, Wales, on 24 April 1922. She studied at University College Cardiff, graduating in 1943 with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, and in 1944 with a Dip.Ed. From 1944 to 1946 she taught Mathematics at Mount School in York. In 1946 she came to Edinburgh to follow the B.Ed. course at the University of Edinburgh under Professor Godfrey Thomson. She was awarded the degree of B.Ed. in 1948. The following year she accepted a post at the Brighton College of Education teaching education and psychology. The experience was an unhappy one for Taylor, who resigned after one term. She wrote to Thomson explaining her predicament, and was offered a position at his education research unit, known as 'Room 70', undertaking administrative work on the Moray House Tests as well as holding the post of assistant lecturer at Moray House training college.  During her time at Moray House, Taylor worked as a Fulbright Scholar at the Educational Testing Service in New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures. In 1952, Taylor was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to spend a year at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this year was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures.  Taylor's post at the Godfrey Thomson Research Unit terminated in 1956, and she became warden of Playfair Hall in East Suffolk Road, Edinburgh, a hall of residence for female Moray House students. During this time, she also worked as a tutor for first year Mathematics students. In 1964, she accepted the post of deputy secretary at the North Regional Examinations Board for the Certificate of Secondary Education, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She remained in this post until 1982, when she retired and moved to Orkney.

In 1938, R. Macgregor M.R.C.V.S. was working in the Veterinary Office, Raub, Pahang, in what was then the Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). Pahang is on the Malayan Peninsula, and agriculture is the main economic activity in Raub today, with fruit growing topping this - principally the cultivation of durians. Most is transported to other cities, especially Kuala Lumpur. Besides fruit, rubber tapping is also carried on. In the 1930s, Macgregor had been writing on the local domestic buffalo - animals which were domesticated essentially for use on uncared for pasture. The buffalo were of two distinct species, or types, one for use on dry ground and the other for use in swamps.

Beale's first trip to Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, was in 1976, when he was awarded a six-month Royal Society Visiting Professorship. Beale used this opportunity to establish a collaborative research programme on malaria with Professor Sodsri Thaithong, and returned on numerous occasions over the next twenty years. As these notes show, Beale also delivered lectures to students at Chulalongkorn University on his visits there.

Hugh Blair FRSE (7 April 1718–27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse. As a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair's teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for Sermons, a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment  Blair's publishers were Thomas Becket or Beckett and Peter Abraham De Hondt James Macpherson was a Scottish writer, poet, literary collector and politician, known as the 'translator' of the Ossian cycle of poems. He was born on 27 October 1736. Blair had arranged the publication of Macpherson's Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland in 1760, and it was Macpherson's Fingal of 1761 that prompted Blair to deliver the lectures that he expanded into A critical dissertation on the poems of Ossian, the son of Fingal published by Becket and De Hondt in London. The same publisher brought out Macpherson's second and final Ossianic epic Temora. James Macpherson died 17 February 1796.

Cargill Gilston Knott, the Scottish physicist, mathematician, and seismologist, was born in Penicuik on 30 June 1856. He was educated at Arbroath High School in Angus, and then he studied at Edinburgh University matriculating there first in 1872. Between 1872 and 1875 Knott studied courses in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Botany, Natural History, Chemistry and Practical Chemistry. He obtained the degree of B.Sc. in 1876 and then the degree of D.Sc. in 1879. His thesis was on researches in contact electricity. He was Tait's assistant in the Natural Philosophy class from 1879 until 1883. In the 1883 he became Professor of Physics and Engineering at the Imperial University of Japan until 1891. On his return to Edinburgh, Knott was Lecturer (1892-1920) then Reader (1920-1922) in Applied Mathematics at the University until his death. Cargill Gilston Knott died on 26 October 1922

Dr. J. Maurice Caborn was a member of staff of the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, Edinburgh University. During the Second World War he served in India. Caborn began studying forestry at the University in 1948 and graduated with the degree of B.Sc. in 1951. He also carried out research for the degree of Ph.D. He worked for the Forestry Commission, serving in Norfolk, and also as a manager on a private forest in Argyll, Scotland. From 1953 he developed a research programme at Edinburgh University on shelterbelts and their influence on microclimate and farm crops. Caborn then did post-doctoral work in Canada with the Department of Agriculture laboratory in Saskatchewan, and also with the University College of Wales. He returned to Edinburgh in 1959 as a Lecturer. He was a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and his research interest was mainly in wind flow around obstacles and wind effects on trees and crops. Dr. J. M. Caborn died on 4 September 1986.

This unpublished report by Professor Emmett L. Bennett Jr. is of the proceedings of a conference held in Wisconsin in 1961, called the Mycenaean Colloquium. The distinguished Classics scholar, Emmett L. Bennett, born in Minnesota in 1918. Bennett is the founding father of the study of Mycenaean scripts. The focus of his life work was the discovery in 1939 of hundreds of Linear B tablets in Pylos, Greece, by the American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887-1971) with whom he had worked while earning his Ph.D. at McMicken College of Arts and Sciences, University of Cincinnati. Bennett edited and analysed the primary inscriptions of the pre-alphabetic syllabic script, Linear B, and to do this he used the same skills he had employed as a cryptographer during World War II.

Thomson outlines his ideals for educational research, which he feels is at its best when conducted by an individual investigating fundamental educational problems. He acknowledges that modern research is in reality constrained by input from collaborators or funders. Thomson discusses how research bodies such as the National Foundation and the Scottish Council for Research in Education can help the researcher in a variety of ways, including not limiting the researcher with too many or too exacting instructions, not demanding too quick a return, and involving the researcher in the design of experiments. He explores team work and co-operation, giving the Scottish Mental Surveys as an example, and emphasises the importance of strong, inspirational, and collaborative leadership. He also discusses the responsibilities of the researcher undertaking individual research, including the design of experiments and the utilising of research tools such as statistics; and the supposed dichotomy of fundamental and operational research. The lecture is written on the reverse side of headed paper from the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology. Edinburgh, 23rd July-29th July.

The letter is dated Doncaster, 26 January 1833, and addressed to Lady Campbell / Barcaldine / Bonaw / Argyleshire. It was written when the young Alexander was 13-years old, and begins, 'My dear Mamma'. The letter writes of making amends and promises to 'write much oftener than I have done previously'; of the 'nice cake' sent to him; and, of the receipt of a letter from Margaret who had said that 'Mary went to shower baths every other day'. The letter tells of how Christmas and New Year was spent, with the teenager going to 'Mrs MacDougall's on the Saturday before Christmas' and going to the Cathedral on Christmas Day. In York, he 'heard the Russian Horn band and went to the Circus and was very much amused with the horses'. The letter goes on to ask how the pony is and supposes that 'he has not been rode much since I left home'. Locally they 'have had some frost here lately and had a little sliding and a few attempts to skate'.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter
from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278.  Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Any

Thomson acknowledges receipt of Ledermann's letter and manuscript, expressing pleasure at Ledermann's continuing interest in factor analysis. Thomson draws parallels between a formula Ledermann uses and the work of Kelley, specifically his pentad criterion as discussed in Crossroads in the Mind of Man.
|
In the first letter, dated 28 Oct 1939 and numbered 12 (39), Thomson refers to Ledermann's manuscript, which he had originally enclosed with some deletions suggested by a referee. These have not survived in the collection. He tells Ledermann that he is unsure if Professor Kendall will apply for a Carnegie Grant, or if Thomson or Ledermann will have to. In the second letter, dated 15 Nov 1939 and numbered 12 a (39), Thomson invites Ledermann to tea and refers him again to the articles by E B Wilson and Jane Worcester, in particular two matrices of loadings which they use and which Thomson transcribes. He informs Ledermann that his son, Hector Thomson, will be continuing with his work in Nicosia.

The lecture regards the problems of examinations at university level, particularly with regards to external and internal examiners, and how these can be resolved. Thomson compares the Scottish system to that of the English, paying particular attention to the examination processes for ordinary degrees in which the Scottish student participates in both the Class Certificate system and the wider examination system of the university; and the English system in which there is a meeting of examiners to decide borderline cases. The notes are incomplete, and largely in draft form.

Thomson defends examinations, discussing their impartiality, fairness, and showing their importance in a democratic society where individuals progress by merit rather than nepotism. Additionally, Thomson also acknowledges the problems of examinations – namely nerves; chance and luck; time pressures on both examinees and examiners; and the inconsistent relationship between examination performance, the school record, and teachers' own ratings. He discusses possible solutions to these problems, citing the marking of the eleven-plus examination in Darlington and Brighton respectively as solutions to the latter. Thomson also touches briefly on the processes involved in making a test.

The lecture was delivered to a wide audience, and is designed to be understood by non-statisticians, and non-educators. In it, Thomson explores the uses and limitations of statistics in both education and psychology, illustrating his points with examples of how an educator might effectively predict a child's performance and offer vocational guidance appropriate to their ability and intelligence.  Thomson discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample and the effect sampling bias has on investigations of causation, and highlights some of the difficulties in obtaining a sample and how these might be overcome. He also touches upon the use of statistics to inform the raising of the school age, and explores the use of statistical methods in collating examination marks to provide indicators of intelligence and predictors of future career success. He highlights the value in using statistical techniques, particularly the concept of distribution, to enhance teachers' ratings of pupils' ability and to enable direct comparison across age groups. He describes intelligence tests as a less subjective indication of future career and performance, while also discussing the phenomenon that an individual's test results in all tests, whether intelligence, dexterity, or vocational fitness, tend to be positively correlated.

The manuscript forming the collection looks at Some principles of arithmetique containing all the parts thereof and the severall ways of working. The manuscript includes three parts: mathematics, law and astronomy. The notes and the exlibris inscription suggest that this volume, which is bound in contemporary calf, was the work of William Baird of Dysart - 'Ex libris Gulielmi Baird'.  The first part, titled 'Some principles of arithmetique containing all the parts thereof and the severall ways of working' includes multiplication and division with examples together with 'decimall arithmetique' and 'logarithmeticall arithmetique.  The second part consists of notes on legal matters in Latin. The third part - consisting of forty-five pages on geometry and astronomy includes such headings as 'the equator', 'the horizone', 'the eclyptick', 'the terrestriall globe', 'longitude terrestriall', 'the celestiall globe', 'the uses of Gunters quadrant', 'the generall horologicall ringe' and 'astronomie'.  There are three folding plates which illustrate the cosmological systems of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Ptolemy.

This is a substantial manuscript book of poems all written by Josiah Conder - quarto, 4-page index followed by 192-pages of poetry, and containing 79 poems. Most of the poems are dated and a few towards the end of the volume are signed. The poems were all written by Conder when he was aged between fifteen and nineteen, and 25 of them may have been published in various places including Conder's first book, The associate minstrels (1810). Perhaps five of the 25 appeared in a children's annual, the Minor's pocket book for 1807 edited by Ann Taylor, daughter of Isaac Taylor. Several of the poems in the volume are signed from Colchester where the Taylors lived from 1796 until 1810 when they moved to Ongar. One of the poems is addressed to Isaac Taylor 'occasioned by his presenting me with a painting of Love, Joy and Mirth', dated 4 March 1806, and another 'To Mrs Taylor, Colchester. On her birthday, June 20, 1809'. The last two pages of the volume comprise a list of 'Verses written since the close of the year 1809', naming 29 poems written in 1810, 1811 and 1812.

Thomson begins by introducing the concept of individual differences in general terms, before moving on to his own topic of intelligence, and discussing the extent of individual intelligence differences. He illustrates the wideness of the intellectual range within the population by reproducing Cyril Burt's table, Distribution of Intelligence among Children and Adults, which contains suggested IQ scores for different levels of schooling and occupational complexity in England. Thomson gives examples of individuals at the extreme ends of intelligence, referring to precocious children, and to a report by the Mental Deficiency Committee on the prevalence of feeble-mindedness in the general population. He argues that this range is both inevitable and vital for society's progress.  Thomson then talks about the measurement of intelligence and stresses that we cannot fully differentiate human intelligence differences into classes, because in reality no such distinctions exist. Instead, intelligence tests identify an individual's position on a continuum.  Thomson ends with a discussion of the idea of selection, emphasising that it is often wrongly thought of as a process of exclusion, when in fact it should regarded and used as part of the process in establishing the correct path for the student, taking into account both their abilities and their interests. In this process, the educators have a social and professional responsibility to guide them in establishing the correct path for them as individuals. He argues that selection should be based not on a single test but following consideration of the pupils' performance throughout their primary school career.

Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.

The letter from H. G. A. (Harry Gidney Aldis) is dated 2 February 1913, Candlemas day, on paper embossed with Grennan, Grantchester Meadows, Cambridge. It is written to 'My dear Johnston' . The letter refers to no further word 'heard from the Astronomer Royal about the incunabula which he is so yearning to send to Cambridge for possible identification'. The letter also talks about illness in the library and about how work offers 'much arrears to mop up before we can venture to start on fifteeners' (incunabula). It goes on to mention how there 'is no photograph or other illustration of the Laing MS of the Philobiblon that I know of' . Aldis has also enclosed 'a rubbing of the binding [...] It is a XVth cent manuscript and the binding is alike on both sides. The letter offers an archival history of the manuscript 'as related by E.G.D.' (possibly E. Gordon Duff). Apparently it had been 'bought by Laing (through Rev. Wm Stevens) in 1839 from J. L. C. Jacob of Rotterdam for 42 francs'. The letter was placed inside a copy of Notices of David Laing : to which is added a chronological list of the various publications which were issued under his editorial superintendence from the year M.DCCC.XV. to the year M.DCCC.LXVIII inclusive, by Thomas George Stevenson, 1878, along with a Letter from Edward Gordon Duff (1863-1924) to Mr. Johnston which is now at E2010.34. The letter is accompanied by the rubbing mentioned above.

This manuscript document is The dying advice of a great man, Duncan Forbes of Culloden esq., late Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland. The document is neither placed nor dated, but circa 1750. It purports to be the last words of the judge and politician Duncan Forbes (1685-1747), who rose to be Lord President of the Court of Session and a leading figure in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion. The religious advice in this manuscript is directed to his son. Although this is almost certainly a copy of the original document, it is a curious fact that the writing gets increasingly scrawled towards the end, almost as though the writer were actually approaching the end. The document is folio, 4-pages, and approximately 1300 words.

The content of the 1st and 2nd year engineering note-books (laboratory books) of Dr. Russell A. Leather reflect the wide approach in studies which covered mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology. The books include graphwork, drawings, and photographs of late-1940s laboratory equipment at Kings Buildings (1948-1949). Photographs feature the 'Riehle' testing machine', the 'Adie' cement testing machine, a torsion testing machine, the 'Ambler' compression machine, the 'Olsen' testing machine, the 'Vickers' hardness testing machine, a tensometer machine, a petrol engine and dynamometer, a gas engine, a 'Leyland' high speed oil engine, the 'Heenan and Froude' hydraulic dynamometer, an air compressor, and a 'Paxman' steam engine. Apparently, experiments involving the 'Paxman' steam engine would be an all-day affair, beginning with start-up of the engine in the morning. The coal fed to the engine would be carefully weighed, and the calorific value of the coal had to be known. Horsepower would have to worked out; measurements taken of energy in and energy out. The note-books consist of:

This is the entrance to the Camera Obscura on the fifth floor of the Outlook Tower. This roof-top pavilion was constructed in 1850 to the design of Marie Therese Short to house her Victorian optical instrument, and was originally called "Short's Observatory". Geddes bought the whole building in 1892 and changed the name to "The Outlook Tower". The "Biological Room" appears to have been formed by covering the roof-top terrace with a temporary cover to protect the plants, of which some are shown here.

The collection is composed of three bound volumes being Sir John Fraser's journal of a tour made around the world in 1935. Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates.

Thomson thanks Ledermann for the sheets, though concludes they were not of great value. He refers to trying times, sending Ledermann good wishes and stating that they will pass. He informs Ledermann that he almost has the calculations accurate, which will allow for the further analysis discussed in previous letters. He tells Ledermann about Hector's travels in Cyprus studying Byzantine buildings, confiding that he isn't sure where he is now, but thinks he is possibly in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The address discusses the apparent schism between scholarship, culture, and vocation, with Thomson making the case that a good education needs to contain aspects of all three in order to produce a whole individual. He illustrates his points with examples of education from around the world.  In relation to this, Thomson discusses the project method, which involves students working together using individual skills, the folkhighschool movement in Denmark, the youth movement in Germany, and the auditorium work present in American high schools.  Thomson argues that everyone is entitled to an education whatever their ability. He stresses that schools do, and should, contain a mixture of students who have access to the same facilities, but whose individual abilities, as well as their interests, are catered to by educators.

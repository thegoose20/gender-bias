Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In 1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890

James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842 Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works areA brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second(1838),An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana(1841),Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases, proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century(1846),New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon(1850),The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original editions(1850), andOutlines of a life of Shakespeare(1881). In the course of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O. Halliwell-Phillipps died on 3 January 1889.

Henry Stewart Noel McFarland was born in Perth on 25 December 1924. He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946.  McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning.  Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK.  McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham. He passed away suddenly in 1973, aged 48.

The Scottish poet and novelist George Mann MacBeth was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, on 19 January 1932. When he was three, his family moved to Sheffield and he was educated at King Edward VII School in the city, before studying at New College, Oxford, with an Open Scholarship in Classics.  On graduating from Oxford, he joined BBC Radio in 1955, working as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the BBC Third Programme, until 1976. He would then resign from the BBC to take up novel writing, and he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury. After a divorce from his first wife, he married the novelist Lisa St Aubin de Terán (b. 1953), and then after a second divorce, he moved with his third wife to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, dying with this in 1992. His work spans four decades and includes: A Form of Words (1954); the editing of the Penguin Book of Sick Verse (1963), and of the Penguin Book of Animal Verse (1965), and the Penguin Book of Victorian Verse (1969); Missile Commander (1965); Shrapnel (1972); the thriller The Samurai (1976); the thriller Cadbury and the Samurai  (1981); The Long Darkness (1984); Trespassing. Poems from Ireland (1991); and, the novel The Testament of Spencer (1992). In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. His Poems from Oby (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society. Macbeth received a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for his work.  George Mann Macbeth died in Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland on 13 February 1992.

Hamish Henderson was Scotland's leading folklorist, as well as a major poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist. He was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. His mother was Janet Jobson Henderson (d. 1933), a cook and housekeeper who had served as a nurse on the western front, and his father was James Scott (1874–1934), an army officer. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian, Jacobite maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. He also spent time in Dundee, Somerset, and Devon. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. In the world of the 1930s, the Depression, the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, and Scottish nationalism at home, would each shape Henderson's worldview and political outlook. When war broke out in September 1939, Henderson attempted to enlist in the Cameron Highlanders but he was rejected because of weak eyesight. He was called up the following year, joining the pioneer corps. However, with a gift for languages, he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer in January 1942, and served in north Africa with the Eighth Army. His service in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily.  During 1947 and 1948 he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. And, over and over again, Henderson's writings displayed a keen and deep appreciation of internationalism, foreign literature, and people's culture. Throughout his life too, he corresponded privately connecting with many of the finest minds of the day, and also wrote through the columns of national newspapers. Towards the end of the 1950s, on 15 May 1959, Henderson married Renate Felicitas (Kätzel) Schmidt (b. 1937) in Coburg, Germany Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene too. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter
from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278.  Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Any

The photographs consist mainly of photographs of Alan Greenwood, staff from the Institute of Animal Genetics and Poultry Research Centre, their relations and visitors, and various events and conferences. There are also a number of photographs showing the construction and opening of the Poultry Research Centre building at Kings Buildings and the sub-station at Easter Bush. There appears to be a combination of official photographs taken, for instance, for a publication, and more informal snapshots. The photographs are mounted on sheets of foolscap paper which have been hole-punched and have presumably been removed from a folder at an earlier stage. The subjects of the pictures are often annotated, probably by Alan Greenwood.  Some sheets have photographs mounted on both sides, while other sheets have clearly had photographs removed. Except where noted, the photographs are in black and white. Many of the photographs are signed 'M.L', which denotes Miron Latyszewski, at that time a research officer at the Institute of Animal Genetics.

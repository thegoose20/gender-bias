The Scottish writer and poet Violet Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine on 1 September 1863 in Angus. The Kennedy-Erskine family owned the Dun estate near Montrose. She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944).  On 3 July 1936, Violet Jacob, authoress, was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Edinburgh. She was noted as a 'writer and poet' in the University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 8. 1936-1937., p34. Latterly Violet Jacob had lived in Kirriemuir, Angus, and she died on 9 September 1946.

Alicia Ann Spottiswoode (Alicia Scott) was born at Spottiswoode House in the Borders (formerly Berwickshire) on 24 June 1810. She was a Scottish songwriter and composer known chiefly for the tune, Annie Laurie, to which the words of a 17th-century poet, William Douglas, were set. She was the oldest daughter of John Spottiswoode of Berwickshire and his wife Helen Wauchope of Niddrie-Mains. On 16 March 1836 she married Lord John Douglas Scott, a younger son of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, and consequently is alternatively known by her courtesy title of Lady John Scott. Lord Scott died in 1860. Lady Scott was a champion of traditional Scots language, history and culture, her motto being 'Haud [hold] fast by the past'. Annie Laurie was published in 1838. Scott died at Spottiswoode on 12 March 1900. Alicia's family home, Spottiswoode House, underwent major rebuilding in 1832-34, and in her poem or song The Lament of the Auld House of Spottiswood, the house humourously chides the laird for desecrating his family's childhood memories.

The letter was written in St. Petersburg, on Grande Morskaia (Bolshaia Morskaia, or Morskaya Street), on 2nd or 15th May 1901, by W. Sedgefield, and addressed to his 'Dear Uncle', W. J. Sedgefield, Esq., Abingdon, Berkshire, England. The envelope, with franking and partial postage stamp, survives. The letter describes the 'annual spring parade of the troops quartered in and around St. P[etersburg]' which took place 'yesterday' - yesterday being 1 May 1901 - on the 'Field of Mars'. Sedgefield was accompanied by ' an intelligent Russian boy', a pupil of his, and whose male relatives were soldiers - 'fathers and uncles being generals and his brothers officers in crack regiments'. The parade took place in front of the Emperor. 'After a long wait the Emperor appeared riding along side of a state carriage drawn by white horses, containing the two Empresses'. One of these ladies was presumably the Empress Dowager.  The letter contains descriptions of the regiments involved in the parade, and description of the horses involved.

Archivist's NoteCheck boxes of duplicates  Grant Buttars 10 February 2003The Scottish writer and poet Violet Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine on 1 September 1863 in Angus. The Kennedy-Erskine family owned the Dun estate near Montrose. She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944).  On 3 July 1936, Violet Jacob, authoress, was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Edinburgh. She was noted as a 'writer and poet' in the University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 8. 1936-1937., p34. Latterly Violet Jacob had lived in Kirriemuir, Angus, and she died on 9 September 1946.

In 1901, Flett took up the post of Petrographer to the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and acquired a comprehensive knowledge of British rocks.

Alicia Ann Spottiswoode (Alicia Scott) was born at Spottiswoode House in the Borders (formerly Berwickshire) on 24 June 1810. She was a Scottish songwriter and composer known chiefly for the tune, Annie Laurie, to which the words of a 17th-century poet, William Douglas, were set. She was the oldest daughter of John Spottiswoode of Berwickshire and his wife Helen Wauchope of Niddrie-Mains. On 16 March 1836 she married Lord John Douglas Scott, a younger son of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, and consequently is alternatively known by her courtesy title of Lady John Scott. Lord Scott died in 1860. Lady Scott was a champion of traditional Scots language, history and culture, her motto being 'Haud [hold] fast by the past'. Annie Laurie was published in 1838. Scott died at Spottiswoode on 12 March 1900. Alicia's family home, Spottiswoode House, underwent major rebuilding in 1832-34, and in her poem or song The Lament of the Auld House of Spottiswood, the house humourously chides the laird for desecrating his family's childhood memories.

In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth.

The letter was written in St. Petersburg, on Grande Morskaia (Bolshaia Morskaia, or Morskaya Street), on 2nd or 15th May 1901, by W. Sedgefield, and addressed to his 'Dear Uncle', W. J. Sedgefield, Esq., Abingdon, Berkshire, England. The envelope, with franking and partial postage stamp, survives. The letter describes the 'annual spring parade of the troops quartered in and around St. P[etersburg]' which took place 'yesterday' - yesterday being 1 May 1901 - on the 'Field of Mars'. Sedgefield was accompanied by ' an intelligent Russian boy', a pupil of his, and whose male relatives were soldiers - 'fathers and uncles being generals and his brothers officers in crack regiments'. The parade took place in front of the Emperor. 'After a long wait the Emperor appeared riding along side of a state carriage drawn by white horses, containing the two Empresses'. One of these ladies was presumably the Empress Dowager.  The letter contains descriptions of the regiments involved in the parade, and description of the horses involved.

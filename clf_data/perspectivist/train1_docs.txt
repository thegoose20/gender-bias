The Ferretti family of Ancona, on the Adriatic, came from Germany in the 14th century. They were men-at-arms. The family enriched themselves in the 17th century during the Wars of Religion in France. The Ferretti family sired military engineers, marine soldiers - Ancona being a base against the Turks - papal diplomatists, a Saint, and a Pope (Pius IX) whose Pontificate from 1846 to 1878 has been the longest in 2000 years. Today, a branch of the Ferretti's of Ancona build powerful leisure craft. The Marche National Archaeological Museum is situated in Ancona's fifteenth century Palazzo Ferretti. This archive of the Ferretti Family begins in 1574 with the last will and testament of the richest man in Ancona at the time 'Il Perillustrissimo Conte Angelo', and closes in the mid-18th century with an impressive marriage and the tale of the family coach.

At the time of his death in 2006, Professor William T. Baxter CA, was Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the London School of Economics (LSE). He had joined the LSE just after the end of the Second World War following periods spent as a student in the USA (at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard), as a part-time Lecturer at Edinburgh University, and as Professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. While in Edinburgh in the 1930s, Baxter met Kenneth E. Boulding (1910-1993), economist, philosopher, poet and Nobel-nominee. Born in Liverpool, England in 1910, and an Oxford garduate, Boulding had held fellowships at Harvard and Chicago, and after a short spell of teaching at Edinburgh University went to the USA for good and finally settled at the University of Colorado. Boulding's first bookEconomic analysiswas an introductory text book which 'blended Keynesian and neoclassical economic theory into a coherent synthesis'. He believed that 'depressions are due to too little private spending and that governments should run deficits to end them'. Baxter is lauded for his theory of deprival value and its use in nationalised and private utilities in the UK, and for his contribution to the accounting standards debate. Professor William T. Baxter died in 2006 at the age of 99-years, and just short of his 100th birthday. Professor Kenneth E. Boulding died in 1993.

John Archibald Watt Dollar, born in 1866, was a member of the equine veterinary practice T. A. Dollar and Sons, Veterinary Surgeons, New Bond Street, London. His father, the founder of the practice, was Thomas Aitken Dollar (1833-1909). The elder Dollar studied at the then Edinburgh Veterinary College and was awarded the Highland and Agricultural Society's certificate in 1851. In 1880, he was Vice-President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. By the time Dollar died on 26 September 1909, the veterinary practice was the largest in London with a presence (veterinary forges) in Baker Street, in Westminster, in Blackfriars, in Lambeth, in Belgrave Square, in Chelsea, and in Paddington. The practice also had paddocks at Wells House Farm, East Acton During the 1880s, John Archibald Watt Dollar and his older brother William Watt Dollar (1860-1938) joined their father's veterinary business, though the younger Dollar spent much of his time travelling abroad and visiting veterinary colleges. John was credited with introducing the first equine operating table to Britain - the table had been designed by himself. He published too and his works include: a translation ofMoeller's operative veterinary surgery(1894), then with Albert Wheatley and othersA handbook of horse-shoeing with introductory chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot(1898), then with Gustave Moussu,Diseases of cattle, sheep, goats and swine(1905), and with Heinrich Moeller, theRegional Veterinary Surgery and Operative Technique (incorporating Prof. Dr. H.

Probably the earliest documented use of an instrument which we today might regard as a passport is an item mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah. During the reign of the ancient Persian ruler Artaxerxes (around 450 BC), the prophet Nehemiah, who was working as a royal cup-bearer but who wished to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, was granted letters from the king requesting the governors of the lands beyond the Euphrates to grant him safe passage to Judah. Closer to our own time and place, in Britain one of the earliest documents to which we can refer as a 'safe conduct' document appeared during the reign of King Henry V of England in an Act of the English Parliament dated 1414. In those days, such a document could be issued by the king to anyone, whether English or not. Later on, from 1540, it became the job of the Privy Council to grant travelling papers and from this point onwards the expression 'passport' began to be used though whether or not it was derived from the notion of travellers passing through seaports ('passer', to pass, and 'port', meaning port or harbour) or through gates in city walls is open to debate. One document issued in June 1641 and signed by King Charles I still exists. Late in the 18th century, the office of the Secretary of State took charge of issuing passports, and it is the Home Office that retains it today. From this time on - from around 1794 - records remain of every British passport which had been granted. They continued to be available to foreign nationals too, and until 1858 they were written in French. After that date, the passport acquired its role as a British identity document. Even so, passports were not generally required for international travel until the First World War. In 1914, and as a result of the British Nationality and Status Aliens Act, the first modern British passport was used. As a result of agreement on the standardisation of passports reached between the member states of the League of Nations, a 'blue' coloured passport still recognised by many today was issued in 1920 and that format served until 1988 and gradual replacement by the 'burgundy' coloured European version in 1988. The letters of safe conduct in this small collection are believed to have been intended for use in the Caucasus, perhaps in Daghestan where the only written language in the nineteenth century was Arabic.

Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit was born in 1585. He was the brother-in-law of William Drummond of Hawthornden, the poet. Scott was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, entering it around 1600. He then studied abroad before returning to Scotland having been called to the Bar. In 1611 he acquired Tarvet and other land in Fife to which he gave the name Scotstarvet. In 1617 he was knighted by King James VI and was made a Privy Councillor.Sir John married three times. His first wife was Anne Drummond, the sister of Drummond of Hawthornden, his second was Elizabeth Melville, and his third Margaret Monpenny.Scott was an important supporter and patron of Scottish learning. He endowed the Chair of Humanity at St. Andrew's in 1620 and was responsible for advancing two major patriotic publication projects - theDelitiae poetarum Scotorum(1637) and the Scottish maps forBlaeu's Atlas Novus(1654). In honour of James VI he published a Latin poemHodoeporicon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scotia sua discessum.His late seventeenth century workThe Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmenwas a reflection on the instability of success, including his own fall from office after years of service to king and country.In 1637, when Charles I insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland, and brought bishops into government, it incited revolution in the form of the National Covenant which was signed at Greyfriar's Kirk, Edinburgh, in 1638, by nobles, ministers and thousands of ordinary Scots. That same year, at the parish church in Ceres, Fife, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet subscribed to the Covenant too. The Covenant demanded a free Scottish Parliament and a free General Assembly - free from the monarch's interference. In 1640, he served on the committee of the Estates for the defence of the country (the Estates was the then Scottish Parliament). During the ensuing war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649.Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit had been a Privy Councillor both to James VI and to King Charles I, and a Lord of Session, and Lord of Exchequer (Scotland). However, during Cromwell's Commonwealth he lost his positions of high office. These would not be given back to him after the Restoration either. He died at Scotstarvet in 1670.In the 18th century the estate of Scotstarvet was bought by Wemyss of Wemyss Hall (Wemyss Hall, near Cupar, Fife).

Royalties earned from Moray House Test sales were transferred into a research fund established by Thomson with the aim of supporting educational research. The fund was later registered as the Godfrey Thomson Research fund. The trust was formally established in 1940, when a Deed of Trust was drawn up between Thomson and the University. The fund was later administered by trustees, with the Professor of Education as Chairman and the Principal of Moray House College of Education as Vice-Chairman.  Additionally, the fund earned income from fees paid by county Education Committees for the analysing, collating and assessing of Moray House Test results.

The science writer and philosopher Thomas Dick was born in Hilltown, Dundee, on 24 November 1774. He was the son of a handloom weaver. He was inspired towards science on seeing a bright meteor in 1783. In 1794 he entered Edinburgh University supporting himself by private tutoring, but he did not proceed to taking the MA degree because of the additional fees. From 1801 he pursued a religious career, entering the Theological Hall of the General Associate Synod of the Secession Church. He was ordained in 1803, became married in 1804, but in 1805 was deposed and excommunicated from the presbytery on being found guilty of adultery. In 1807 Dick turned to teaching, becoming a schoolmaster in Methven and forming a mechanics' institute. In 1817 he left Methven for Perth and a post at Stewart's Free Trades' School. As well as teaching he involved himself in astronomical observations and built a telescope. He published articles in literary, religious and scientific publications, and these included Christian philosopher, or, The connection of science and philosophy with religion (1832), Philosophy of religion (1826), Philosophy of a future state (1828), Celestial scenery (1837), and Practical astronomer (1845). Thomas Dick died on 29 July 1857.

Florence Bruce Dorward was born in Galashiels on 28 August 1912. She was the eldest child of Norman James Dorward and Elizabeth Haig Bruce. Her father, and his brother Adam, ran the family tweed clothing manufacturing firm J. & J. C. Dorward of Galashiels. In October 1925, following the death of her father, Florence was sent as a 'boarder' to St. Trinnean's School, Edinburgh. However, when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1928 she became a 'day-girl' at the school. St. Trinnean's School had been founded in Edinburgh by Miss Catherine Fraser Lee in 1922 and when it opened in October of that year it had just 60 girls as students. It was located in a building at 10 Palmerston Road, just off Grange Road in Edinburgh. Miss Lee practised the Dalton system of education with an emphasis on self-discipline. Later, in 1925, the school moved to St. Leonard's House, off Dalkeith Road in Edinburgh, but the outbreak of the Second World War then forced the girls and staff to be evacuated to Galashiels, to Gala House. In the 1950s, a series of St Trinian'scomedy films was made, starring Alastair Sim, George Cole, and Joyce Grenfell, and with the school depicted as a quite unorthodox one and where the girls wreaked havoc. Florence left the real St. Trinnean's in summer 1930 and then attended the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy which was located at Atholl Crescent, Edinburgh. In October 1931 she obtained a Housewife's Diploma First Class, and a Cook's Certificate From October 1931 to July 1932 Florence worked as a cook at Canaan Park School in South Oswald Road, Edinburgh, and between October 1933 and August 1935 she worked in Ettrick Road, Edinburgh - probably at a nursing home run by a Miss Eleanor Murdy - and then as a cookery demonstrator with the Southern Scottish Electric Supply Company Ltd., in Galashiels. Later in 1935, and until February 1936, she visited family in South Africa. Over 1938-1939 she was an Assistant Manageress at a Mackie's Buttery. During the war, on 29 June 1940, Florence Bruce Dorward married Thomas Cowan Steven who later became a Chartered Accountant and partner in the firm William Home Cook, Robertson Maxtone Graham, and Thomas McLintock. The couple had a son in 1942, and then a daughter in 1945. In May 1975, Florence gave her war-time wedding outfit, the receipts for it, and trousseau items, to the National Museum of Antiquities, Queen Street, Edinburgh, where it was displayed in the then 'Costume Gallery' a year later. She is also noted as having attended the St. Trinnean's School Reunion which was a 'sit down' buffet luncheon held on Thursday 22 October 1998 at the John McIntyre Centre, Pollock Halls, Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh. A look around the old school building had been planned too. A Reunion had also been held at the same place in 1985. Florence Bruce Steven died on 25 November 2008. She had been pre-deceased by her husband, 10 May 1988. Her old school, St. Trinnean's, had closed its doors in 1946 on the retiral of Miss Lee. St. Leonard's Hall which housed St. Trinnean's between 1925 and the outbreak of war is now within Pollock Halls of Residence, Edinburgh University, and has an administrative, hospitality and conference function. It was built in 1869 by John Lessels (1809-1883) in Baronial style. During the First World War the building was used as a Red Cross Hospital, and during the Second World War it became an Air Raid Precautions and Home Guard Headquarters. St Leonard's became a hall of residence for female students until the completion of the more modern buildings on the Pollock site from the 1960s onwards.

James Stanley Cavaye was born in 1914. He served as a Councillor in Edinburgh. He was first elected as a Progressive to the old City of Edinburgh Corporation in 1970 and switched to the Conservatives two years later. When local government was reorganised in 1974 he successfully stood as a Tory for both Lothian Regional Council and Edinburgh District Council. His working life was spent in Portobello Power Station, originally run by the municipal Electricity Department, latterly the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Cavaye had been a collector of glass-plate slides for 'magic lantern shows', buying these in the small junk shops that used to be found in Edinburgh's Grassmarket and the West Bow. He found and saved the Begbie Collection of very early glass-plate photographs of Edinburgh. They were found in a flat in St. James Square in 1950. He gifted the plates to the City Arts Centre, Edinburgh, in 1990. The gift is known as the 'Cavaye Collection of Thomas Begbie Plates'. He was a founder and former Chair of the Edinburgh Festival Volunteer Guides Association (set up in 1947) which gave tours of the Royal Mile. He also gave lectures on the history of Edinburgh. Stanley Cavaye died in 2004. He was buried at Liberton Cemetary on Thursday 12 February 2004.

The Lords of the Congregation were a group of Protestant Scottish nobles who in the mid-16th century favoured reformation of the church along Protestant principles and a Scottish-English alliance. They had opposed the marriage of the young Queen Mary - daughter of James V and Mary of Guise - to the Dauphin of France (who became King Francis II of France from 1559 to 1560) and signed the 'First Band' or Covenant to work to make Scotland Protestant.  Following religious riots in Perth, the Lords gained support and provided military help to John Knox in opposing the troops of Mary of Guise. Near Cupar, in Fife, the Lords were strong enough to face-off a French and Scottish army jointly led by the Duke of Chatelherault, who as Regent had supported the French match, and D'Oysel the French king's lieutenant. By July 1559 the Lords of the Congregation had taken Edinburgh. As Edinburgh Castle was held against them, the Lords withdrew under the terms of the truce of the Articles of Leith.  In September, Chatelherault, now joined by his son the Earl of Arran, changed sides and became leader of the Congregation Lords. Mary of Guise, who had earlier offered a degree of religious tolerance, maintained that their motives were secular in part. Queen Mary and King Francis wrote to her in November 1559, declaring that the lords were acting maliciously under the name and cloak of religion. French re-inforcements pushed the Lords and their Protestant army back to Stirling and Fife. By the Treaty of Berwick in February 1560, the Lords brought in an English army to resist the French troops. The armed conflict now centered on the Siege of Leith. After the death of the Queen Regent in June and the conclusion of hosilities at Leith by the Treaty of Edinburgh in July, the Scottish Reformation was effected - through the Scots Confession of Faith - in the Parliament of Scotland in August 1560. After events reported in the document described here, the Congregation suffered a series of setbacks, with Mary of Guise retaking Edinburgh. However the arrival of English troops by sea in January 1560 sealed the course of reformation in Scotland. The Reformation Parliament which was convened in Edinburgh 10 July 1560 would appoint John Knox and others to draw up the Scots Confession of Faith. Thomas Henderson referred to in the document was a burgess of Jedburgh at this time, and Sir John Forster (c.1515-1602) was an English administrator in the Scottish borders, deputy warden of the English middle march.

Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959.

James Robertson was born in the parish of Cromarty in 1714. He studied at Aberdeen and then at Leyden University where he graduated in January 1749. At Leyden he had studied under Albert Schultens, the Dutch orientalist. He next went to Oxford studying Hebrew under Thomas Hunt. Robertson was offered the Chair of Hebrew in Doddridge's Theological Academy in Northampton, but instead became Professor of Hebrew at Edinburgh University on 25 June 1751 backed by a testimonial from Schultens. He compiled the Grammatica linguae Hebraeae (1758) and later on published The resemblance of Jesus to Moses considered (1765), and Clavis Pentateuchi (1770), the latter of which was a critical analysis of the Hebrew version of the Pentateuch. Between the years 1763 and 1785, Robertson was also the University Librarian and with a small team he compiled the Library's first alphabetical catalogue. James Robertson retired from the Chair of Hebrew in 1792. After some years of physical infirmity, he died at Middlefield, Leith, in Edinburgh, on 26 November 1795.

This collection is composed simply of an invitation - dated 6 August 1907 - from the elders, managers and members of the congregation to the Rev. William Dobbie to take up the post of Pastor at Castle Hill United Free Church in Forres, Moray, Scotland. William Dobbie was born on 21 May 1881 in Ayr. He attended Ayr Academy and studied at Glasgow University. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Ayr in May 1906, and assisted at Glasgow Camphill until 1907 when he was ordained and inducted at Castle Hill U. F. Church in Forres, 20 September 1907. Dobbie married Jean Fulton Hamilton on 25 April 1911. In 1914 he translated to Glasgow Govanhill and then did war service with the YMCA in France in 1916. In 1921 he translated to Lanark Cairns. The Rev. William Dobbie died on 30 April 1946. For the origins of Castlehill U. F. Church, we have to look at events of 1733 when the First (or original) Secession saw members leave the Church of Scotland as a protest against the system of Patronage, by which a minister was appointed to a congregation on presentation by a landowner. A congregation was founded in 1768, when a group in Forres joined the Secession Movement. The first church was built at the north end of Batchen Street, Forres. It had various names over time: United Secession; United Presbyterian; and, United Free. The foundation stone of the Castlehill Church was laid on September 22, 1870, and it was opened and dedicated on November 26, 1871, with building costs of £3,000. In 1900, the United Presbyterian and the Free Churches united to form the United Free Church of Scotland. This meant that there were two U.F. Churches in Forres, and each had to take a distinctive name. It was at that point that it was named Castlehill, from the site on which it stood, and the other became the High Church. In 1902 the Town Council presented the freedom of the burgh to Lord Strathcona in Castlehill Church. In 1903 James MacDougall Black became the minister and remained until 1907. Dr Black was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1938-1939. Two outbreaks of dry-rot, in 1902 and in 1946, meant that extensive and expensive work was necessary, and this was paid for by the congregation and by generous donations from Lord and Lady Strathcona and Andrew Carnegie. When the Rev. David Leslie Scott, Minister of Forres Castlehill Church, retired on 30 June 1972 the church was closed and the charge united with Forres High Church under the name of Forres St Leonard's. The former Castlehill Church was sold to the Forres Parish Church of St. Laurence and became its church halls. After a protracted period of refurbishment, it was eventually opened and dedicated on September 5, 1976. Dry-rot however can never be eradicated completely and some thirty years after the last repair the rot had reached such as state that it became beyond the economic means of the congregation of the Parish Church of St. Laurence. The building was finally sold on 30 June 2006, which was 34-years after the building was closed as a church.

Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760.

The mathematician, statistician, writer, composer and musician, Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He was of Scottish descent. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912. On winning a university scholarship in 1912 he went on to study at the University of Otago in 1913, enrolling in Mathematics, French and Latin. Studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry. Aitken saw action in Gallipoli and Egypt, and he was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. After his hospitalisation, he returned to New Zealand in 1917. On the completion of his studies in 1920, Aitken became a school-teacher at Otago Boys' High School and the same year he married Winifred Betts the first lecturer in Botany at the University of Otago where he also did some tutoring. Then, encouraged by a professor of mathematics at the University, he gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Aitken's publications include: jointly with H. W. Turnbull,The theory of canonical matrices(1932); with D. E. Rutherford, a series of Mathematical Texts; wartime experiences inGallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand infantryman(1963); and, posthumouslyTo catch the spirit. The memoir of A.C. Aitken with a biographical introduction by P.C. Fenton(1995). He made many important contributions to the many fields of his subject, particularly in the theory of Matrix Algebra and its application to various branches of mathematics. In his time, Professor Aitken was one of the fastest mathematical calculators in the world. While at school, Aitken had learned to play the violin, and later on in life he played both the violin and viola and composed pieces for performance by university groups. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967.

Charlotte Auerbach first met Hermann Joseph Muller when he arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1938. He was to remain at the Institute before 1940 before returning to the United States. His presence at the Institute had a profound influence on many workers there at that time, particularly Auerbach, who said 'Never have I met anybody who combined such penetrating analytical powers with such a breadth and depth of scientific imagination; nor anybody who combined such an absolute rejection of any type of supernatural belief with such a passionate and visonary belief in the perfectability of the human species and of the geneticists' responsibility to work towards this end.'

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

The Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) which was the forerunner of the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW) was founded on 15 October 1868 at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh. The following year, Sophia Jex-Blake won the right for women to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius who, with others, was able to use combined influence to win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the Association were being printed in the University Calendar thus forging the link between the University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes, and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved, the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By 1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s.

Marie Laurencin was born in Paris on 31 October 1883. She attended the Lycee Lamartine in the city before studying porcelain painting at the Sevres factory. Later on she entered the Academie Humbert. In 1907 she exhibited at the Clovis Sagot gallery in Montmartre, and there she was introduced to Guillaume Apollinaire by Pablo Picasso and she became romatically involved with Apollinaire until 1913. In 1908, Laurencin achieved her first sale when Gertrude Stein purchasedGroup of artists. This group portrait of Laurencin, Apollinaire, and Picasso and his mistress became the theme of a larger version in 1909 entitledApollinaire and his friends. In 1911 she exhibited in the Salon des Independants, and she began illustrating books. The ending of her relationship with Apollinaire in 1913 also saw the end of her Cubist-inspired period. In 1913, Laurencin established a contract with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg which would last until 1940, and in 1914 she married the German Baron, Otto von Waetjen. On the outbreak of war however they fled to Spain and spent time in Madrid and Barcelona, and then also to Germany. In 1921 she returned to Paris and in the same year she divorced von Waetjen. The early-1920s saw Laurencin designing sets and costumes most notably for the Ballets Russes -Les Biches- as well as painting society portraits including that of Coco Chanel. In the 1930s she was teaching at the art academy, Villa Malakoff. In 1942 she publishedLe Carnet des nuits. In 1944, her apartment on Rue Savorgnan de Brazza was requisitioned by the Germans and she did not get it back until 1953. Marie Laurencin died in Paris on 8 June 1956 and she was buried in the cemetary Pere Lachaise.

James Griffith Macaskie was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed on 1 December 1856. He was the third son of George Macaskie. James attended Berwick Grammar School and then went to Edinburgh to study at the School of Medicine, Surgeon's Hall. He lived with his uncle, Dr. J. Cochran, and he assisted at the Apothecary of a relative in the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. He was awarded a Bronze Medal for Physiology (Second Prize) while at Surgeon's Hall and was given a set of surgical instruments. He completed his studies at the young age of 21, and became an assistant to Dr. Crompton in Bury, Lancashire, before qualifying in 1878 - Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh) LRCS, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh) LRCP. Macaskie registered in England on 20 September 1878. In 1880, Macaskie became an assistant to Dr. Lewis G. Broadbent MD in Bamburgh, Northumberland, and became a practice partner in 1883. With his prospects secure, he married Marianne Kidd, daughter of a Tynemouth solicitor. In 1890 he took examinations in Edinburgh for the Diploma in Public Health (DPH Glasgow). On the retiral of Dr. Broadbent in 1891, Macaskie took up residence in the Doctor's House (thus also taking on the free Dispensary at Bamburgh Castle supported by the Lord Crewe Charity). During the Great War of 1914-1918, two of Macaskie's sons served with the RMC in Egypt and India, and a third was Commissioned in 1918 and served in France. That son died in 1924 due to ill-health acquired during the War. Macaskie retired in 1927 and he moved to Harrogate to be close to a brother. On the death of that brother, he returned To Northumberland, to Seahouses, in 1936. Dr. James Griffiths Macaskie died on 3 January 1945.

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

The English composer, music journalist and pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji on 14 August 1892 in Chingford, Essex. He was the son of a Parsi father and a Spanish-Sicilian mother. As a composer Sorabji was self-taught. As a critic Sorabji was connected to the radical weekly New Age magazine which had been taken over by Alfred Richard Orage, and to New English Weekly. His music criticism was notable for its acerbity and wit, and also for championing - at the time - unfashionable composers such as Mahler and Szymanowski. His own works were of great complexity, and he played them in London and Paris in 1921 and in Vienna in 1922. Thereafter he discouraged public performance of his music until relenting in the mid-1970s. He remained something of a cult figure however. His works included the Symphonic High Mass (1955-1961), the massive (four-hour), multi-movement Opus clavicembalisticum (1930), and the Etudes transcendantes (1940-1944).  Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji died at Winfrith Newburgh, near Dorchester, in Dorset on 15 October 1988. He had been a friend of the composer Alistair Hinton, who was the founder of the Sorabji Archive. In 1994 many of his original manuscripts went to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle, Switzerland.

These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory. At this time Beale was studying the change from serotype D to serotype B of stock 51 (variant 4). The cells were treated with an immunising and potentially lethal solution containing anti-D antibodies, which lead to the cells becoming 'resistant' to the immunising action. Tracy Sonneborn had previously shown that the 'sensitive' and 'resistant' types of cell were 'hereditary'. Beale demonstrated that this change involved a replacement of the initial antigen (D) by another one (B) which could take place in every cell which was treated, and that for an intermediate period, both antigens could be detected in a single cell. Beale published a paper on the subject in 1948 entitled 'The process of transformation of antigenic type in Paramecium' which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA (34, 418-423).

The study is concerned with 'one of the earliest known historical accounts of Acadian Deportation' which was written by the Rev. Dr. Andrew Brown in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Brown's manuscript was entitled Removal of the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia by Lieut. Governor Lawrence and His Majesty's Council in October 1755. The primary purpose of the study was to provide an annotated edition of the manuscript, but it also takes a broader look at Brown. The external thesis was written by Sara J. Beanlands of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was submitted to Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in September 2010.

John Donaldson was born in 1789. He studied Law and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1826, though he was also a well-known teacher of music in Edinburgh. Though unsuccessful in his earlier candidacy in 1841, he was elected to the Reid Professorship of Music at Edinburgh University in 1845 on the death of Professor John Thomson. It was Donaldson who established a museum and purchased old and unusual musical instruments which today forms the John Donaldson Collection. As well as founding this collection which illustrates the history of music and acoustics, he built a fine hall as his music classroom with adjoining museum gallery, now known as the Reid Concert Hall. An organ built by Messrs. Hill and Sons (London) was constructed in the music classroom. It is said that Donaldson's lectures were not especially successful because he was not a practical musician, devoting himself rather more to the theory of harmony and investigating obscure questions of acoustics. Nevertheless, he held the Professorship until his death at Marchfield, his home near Edinburgh, on 12 August 1865.

William McLaren (1923–1987) was born in Ferniegair, Hamilton, but grew up in Cardenden, Fife, Scotland with a crippling handicap that affected his feet. He attended Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, before going to college in Edinburgh. In 1944 he earned his Diploma and the Highly Commended Post Diploma from Edinburgh College of Art. After graduation and with a bursary from the Andrew Grant Fund he left Scotland and visited Italy and France. Throughout his life he remained a francophile and was fluent in French. McLaren earned a living as a commercial illustrator working for such titles as The Radio Times and The Listener. He is noted for illustrating the popular Beverley Nichols gardening books. He also painted murals at Wemyss Castle, St Adrian's Church in West Wemyss, Hopetoun House, Hawthornden Castle and Tyninghame House. He also produced a portfolio of work around Edmund Spenser's Prothalamion.  Edmund Spenser (c. 1552 – 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene (1590-1596), an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognised as one of the premier craftsmen of Modern English verse in its infancy, and one of the greatest poets in the English language. Following The Faerie Queene Spenser released Prothalamion, a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke.

James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842 Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works areA brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second(1838),An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana(1841),Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases, proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century(1846),New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon(1850),The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original editions(1850), andOutlines of a life of Shakespeare(1881). In the course of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O. Halliwell-Phillipps died on 3 January 1889.

Charles Hedges was born in either 1649 or 1650. he was educated at Magdalen, Oxford, where he took a B.A. in 1670, an M.A. in 1673, and a D.C.L in 1675. In his last year of study he was admitted to the Society of Advocates, and by 1686 he was Chancellor and Vicar-General of the Diocese of Rochester. In 1689 he was created Master of the Faculties and Judge of the Admiralty Court. Hedges was also knighted on 4 June 1689. From 1698 he contested various constituencies for a seat in Parliament including Orford in Suffolk, Dover, Calne and Malmesbury, West Looe, and East Looe. In 1700 he became a Secretary of State and Privy Councillor with the help of the Earl of Rochester (1641-1711). For some time Sir Charles Hedges resided at Richmond Green, but in 1700 he bought an estate in Compton Bassett, near Calne in Wiltshire. Hedges died on 10 June 1714. The background to the collection item, from Hedges as Secretary of State, to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is the Aliens Act of 1705 which stated that, from Christmas Day 1705 until the Scottish Parliament passed an Act settling the Scottish Crown upon the successor to the English Crown, every Scot should be considered an alien. At the time that the letter was written (November 1706) the Viceroy (Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland was James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde KG, KT (1665–1745), Irish statesman and soldier. The Duke of Ormonde had succeeded the Earl of Rochester to the post in 1703, and was Viceroy until 1707.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. Hancock and Beatty continued to collaborate in and correspond about this work after Hancock moved to the University of Bristol. Hancock published 'Comparisons of effects of normal rabbit sera and anti-cock sperm sera on rabbit sperm, including comparison of effects on the sex ratio' in Biology of Reproduction, 18:510-515 (1978).

The Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland, now subsumed by the Institute of Governance, was acknowledged as the leading centre in the country for studies of Scottish society and politics. At the centre of the Unit's work was the study of policy-making and the political process in Scotland, set in a broad comparative and international context. Constitutional change in Scotland had been one of the Unit's central themes since its founding in the mid-1970s for which it drew on diverse disciplines, notably in Law and Social Sciences. It conducted The Scottish Election Study, which provided an in-depth account of how and why Scotland voted at the 1997 General Election, especially in the context of long-term changes in electoral attitudes and behaviour. A similar study had focused on the Scottish Referendum in September 1997. The Unit was followed by the Governance of Scotland Forum in 1998, and then by the Institute of Governance in 2002 A number of publications had emanated from the Unit throughout the 1980s and 1990s on a variety of issues, including pieces on the re-organisation of Scottish local government, management of councils, financing Scottish home rule, gender and Scottish society, labour market policy in Britain, citizenship, Scottish churches and the political process, women in Scottish politics, data protection and privacy, and democratic participation in the Scottish Parliament.

Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.

In a letter to the Ford Foundation on 20 January 1977, Beatty gave his reasons for deciding to withdraw from the Centre: 'It has recently become apparent that the projected completion date for the Reproductive Biology Building will be late 1979 or early 1980. I retire in April 1980 and it no longer makes sense for me to think of moving into the new building. It would be more realistic for me to withdraw now and make way for the finding of some alternative group to occupy the accommodation earmarked for me.'

The Edinburgh University Sailing Club (EUSC) was founded in 1933 as the Edinburgh University Yacht Club. EUSC is one of the largest sports clubs within the University and its dinghy teams are the most successful teams in Scotland. EUSC is located at the Edinburgh University Sports Union, Pleasance, Edinburgh. Club sailing takes place at Linlithgow Loch, West Lothian, for dinghies, and Largs (Clyde) and Port Edgar (Forth) for yachting. The EUSC is a group member of the Linlithgow Loch Sailing Club. In the 1980s and 1990s EUSC meetings were held on Tuesdays in the Pleasance, and in more recent years at the Wash Bar, Mound, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evenings. The EUSC Cameron Trophy sailing event has been held at Firbush - the University's field centre on Loch Tay - and in the Firth of Forth (the 35th Cameron Trophy was hosted by the Royal Forth Yacht Club). The Trophy has traditionally been held over a weekend during Freshers Week at Firbush, or rather during the weekend immediately before the start of the Autumn term. Club records also show that there has been a Sailing Club Regatta held in in May. The Club has held grand social events such as the Edinburgh University Watersports Ball which was often held at the Prestonfield House Hotel, Edinburgh, but was, in November 1989, held at the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, as well as dinner dances, Hallowe'en, Christmas and Burns functions. Some of these still happen, along with beer and skittles and pub quizzes. The above-mentioned Cameron Trophy had been presented by Lord Cameron to the Edinburgh University Sports Union in the early 1970s. Lord Cameron had served with the RNVR in both world wars and in the Second World War had held the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. He was an honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club and was awarded an honorary blue for his interest in Edinburgh University sport. He held a particular interest in sailing and so the Sports Union decided to invite the EUSC to run an annual regatta at which the winner would be presented with the Cameron Trophy which he had presented. Earlier in the Club's history the trophy was called the Lord Cameron Trophy. Lord Cameron died in 1996, aged 96.

Beale visited Chulalongkorn University as a Royal Society Leverhulme Visiting Professor, with support from the Wellcome Trust, from November 1976 to May 1977. His visit was to obtain first-hand information about malaria and to collect samples of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
|
In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.

The Dutch marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger was born in 1633 and baptised in Leiden, Holland, in the Dutch Republic. He was a son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, also a marine painter. The younger van de Velde, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute, and had achieved great celebrity in his art before he came to London. In 1673 he moved to England, where he was engaged by Charles II, at a salary of £100, to aid his father in 'taking and making draughts of sea-fights'. His part of the work was to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder van de Velde. He was also patronised by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility. Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. Willem van de Velde the Younger died on 6 April 1707 in London, England and was buried at St. James's Church. The MP John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor, was born on 8 November 1790. He was born the son of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor and Lady Caroline Howard and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1912.

From 1945 to 1948 Robson served as a Captain with the Royal Army Medical Corps in India, Palestine and Egypt, and then in 1948 he married Mary Kynoch Macdonald. On demobilisation from military service he worked for a brief period with Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Clinical Chemistry Laboratories teaching medical students and postgraduate doctors, and researching kidney function and looking at patients with disturbances of water and electrolyte balance. In 1949 however, he was awarded a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship and he again travelled to the USA to the Department of Nutrition and Biochemistry, Harvard. In 1950 he was back in Edinburgh and with Hugh Dudley (born 1925) he set up a treatment centre for acute reversible renal failure, and with his wife, the pathologist Dr. Mary MacDonald, the Edinburgh renal biopsy service was established. This groundwork led to the first successful kidney transplant operation in the UK, performed in 1960 by Professor Sir Michael Woodruff at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Robson became Reader in Therapeutics at Edinburgh University in 1961, Reader in Medicine in 1969, and Professor of Medicine in 1977. He played a prominent role in the revision and modernisation of the Edinburgh University undergraduate medical curriculum. The nephrologist James Scott Robson, Emeritus Professor of Medicine, died in Edinburgh on 14 March 2010

The Scottish painter David Wilkie was born on 18 November 1785 at Cults, Fife. He went to school locally at at Pitlessie, and at Kettle, Fife. While at school he was able to exercise a drawing ability which was obvious at an early age. When he was fourteen, in 1799, he set off to Edinburgh, to the Trustee's Academy of Design in St. James's Square. While there he made progress in painting portraits and miniatures. In 1804 he returned to Cults and there he produced a painting of the Pitlessie Fair which made him very well-known. After a brief stay in Aberdeen, Wilkie sailed for London in May 1805 where he continued his studies. His painting of The Village Politicians brought him more attention and, of course, new commissions. On the death of his father in 1812, his mother and sister came to London to join him, and from 1812 the family lived in Kensington, initially at Lower Philimore Place. Works by Wilkie include: The Reading of the will; The Highland family; Princess Doria washing Pilgrims' feet; Guerilla Council of War; Preaching of Knox before the Lords of the Congregation, 10 June 1559; The Duke of Wellington writing a despatch; and Napoleon and the Pope in Conference at Fontainebleau. David Wilkie was knighted in June 1836. In 1840, he travelled to Istanbul (then called Constantinople) where he painted Abdul Medjid, the young Sultan, and then went on to Jerusalem in 1841. That year he set off home again reaching Alexandria on 26 April 1841, and there he painted Pacha Mehemet Ali. A month later he sailed again, but after departing from Gibraltar on 1 June 1841, he died. On account of the quarantine regulations of the period, Sir David Wilkie was buried at sea at latitude 36 degrees 20' north and 6 degrees 42' west.

The Main Library building of Edinburgh University Library was opened on George Square, Edinburgh in 1967. The new building was designed by J. Hardie Glover and Andrew Merrylees of the Sir Basil Spence partnership Spence, Glover & Ferguson (Edinburgh). Planning started in 1963 and construction began in March 1965. The building featured external materials such as Portland stone, concrete and glass, and interior finishes included teak, white beech, glazing, carpet tiling, and quartzite flooring. Furnishings in the building included Danish chairs in black plywood and stainless steel. When the new Library building was completed in September 1967, Edinburgh University Library began the move of some 2-million books from its old location, Playfair Library in the Old Quad' (designed by Robert Adam). Although the Main Library building has provided excellent space through its 40 year history, by the 2000s it was struggling to provide the facilities and working spaces required for 21st century methods of teaching, learning and research. In addition, four decades of wear and tear on the building meant that it was in need of a comprehensive upgrade. The University has invested 60 million in refurbishing the building to make it fir for new purpose. The article in the 1968 magazine piece featured in this collection was Jim Burgess, and the photographer was Henk Snoek (1915-1980). Snoek was said to be 'one of Britain's most accomplished architectural photographers', and worked for architects as diverse as Basil Spence and Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall. He was born in the Netherlands, and he studied at the Hague School of Art. Snoek's photography reflected the Bauhaus principles on which the Hague School of Art was run, and was 'characterised by a strong sense of drama, simple, forceful lines and high contrasts'.

Thomas Hudson Middleton was born in Cromarty, Ross-shire, on 31 August 1863. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh, and he studied at Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities. In 1889 he became Professor of Agriculture at Baroda College, India, until his appointment as Lecturer in in Agriculture at the University College of Wales in 1896. In 1898 and in 1899 he made unsuccessful attempts on the Chairs of Agriculture at Yorkshire College, Leeds, and at Cambridge. In 1899 however he became Professor of Agriculture at Durham College of Science, and then in 1902 he did become Professor of Agrculture at Cambridge where he stayed until 1907. In 1906 he had been appointed as Assistant Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, and by 1917 he was Deputy Director-General at the Food Production Department. In 1926, Middleton was appointed to the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India. He received a C.B. in 1913 and was made Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918.

The second edition of Holinshed's history of Britain was the edition used by William Shakespeare as the principal source for his histories and also for Macbeth.  The printing history of this work is of particular interest. In February 1587, the printers were ordered by the Privy Council and the Archbishop of Canterbury to delete nine passages that contained objectionable accounts of recent history - three in volume II (Scotland), six in volume III (England). The Privy Council censored text, but of course the printers had to cancel whole leaves, 82 leaves in all. Most surviving copies of the work were duly 'castrated' to order, and cancels (only twelve of them) were inserted to bridge the gaps. In the eighteenth century the original text was reprinted three times from an 'uncastrated' copy or copies, and after 1722 or 1723 these reprinted leaves were generally used to complete later-bound collectors' sets in facsimile. As an interesting aside, some original leaves could escape the Privy Council knife, as in one instance in this Edinburgh University Library copy, where in volume III, there are untouched leaves relating to a report of English support for the Duke of Alençon's departure in 1582 to assume sovereignty of Zeeland. This was an unhappy episode which was to mark a failure in Elizabeth's policy in the Low Countries. The cancel is said to reduce the report from 362 lines to 12. This Edinburgh copy also includes 4 of the original 1587 cancel leaves inserted loose alongside their 18th century facsimile replacements (representing, in volume II, pp. 421, 424, 438, 431, 443, 444, 445 and 450).

Duncan Forbes was born on 10 November 1685, the second son of Duncan Forbes of Culloden and Bunchrew, near Inverness. He went to Edinburgh University to study law, but in 1705 proceeded to Leiden instead to study civil law and oriental languages, returning to Scotland in 1707. He was admitted as an advocate in 1709, and was also appointed Sheriff of Midlothian around the same time. During the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, his brother John Forbes (who had joined with Simon Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat) accompanied him to Inverness where they raised forces in support of the government. Duncan was rewarded with the office of Depute-Advocate which he took up in 1716. In 1721-22, Forbes was MP for Ayr, and in 1722 he was returned in Inverness. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Advocate in succession to Robert Dundas of Arniston. As the English system of taxation was extended into Scotland troubles began to arise and rioting took place in Glasgow in 1725. Forbes accompanied a force commanded by General Wade, and the Glasgow magistrates were arrested for their negligence and brought to Edinburgh with some of the rioters. They were later freed. Edinburgh too suffered trouble within the brewing industry at this time. In 1735, Forbes succeeded to the family estates on the death of his brother. In 1737 he opposed the Bill bringing penalties on the City of Edinburgh after the Porteous Riots. In the wake of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, he protested against the cruelties of the Duke of Cumberland. Duncan Forbes died on 10 December 1747.

William Shepherd Morrison was born on 10 August 1893, one of eight sons of John Morrison of Torinturk, Argyll, and Marion Morrison. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and during his schooling entered the Officers Training Corps (OTC), 1906-1912. He studied Arts and Law at Edinburgh University, beginning in 1912, and continued in the OTC Artillery, 1912-1914. When the First World War broke out, Morrison interrupted his studies and in August 1914 entered the Royal Field Artillery, Special Reserve, as a 2nd Lieutenant. In March 1915 he was wounded at Neuve Chapelle, a British offensive in the Artois region, and in March and June 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches. In March 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross, and by June 1915 he was a Lieutenant, and September 1916 an Acting Captain. In January 1916 he was again mentioned in Dispatches, and in November 1917 he became a Captain. Once more, in March 1919, he was mentioned in Dispatches. Towards the end of hostilities, he served with the Scottish Command Gas School, 1918-1919. In 1919 he resigned his Commission. Morrison resumed his studies at Edinburgh University and while there was President of the University Union and Senior President of the Students Representative Council. He obtained the degree of M.A. in 1920. In 1923 he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in London. Also in 1923, in December that year, and again in October 1924, in General Elections, he contested for the Unionists in the Western Isles, Scotland, campaigning in Gaelic. In 1924 too, he married Katharine Allison Swan, in Leith. She had also been a graduate of Edinburgh University and she too was reading for the Bar. As far as a political career was concerned, Morrison would not become an MP until 1929 when he won the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, in England, for the Conservatives. He would hold the seat though for some thirty years, until 1959. He became a KC (Kings Council) in 1934, and was appointed recorder of Walsall, Staffordshire, in 1935. He became Financial Secretary to the Treasury later that year. In 1936 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and a member of the Privy Council. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Food in 1939-40, Postmaster-General in 1940-42, and Minister of Town and Country Planning from 1943 until 1945 when his party went into Opposition. By 1951, the year when the Conservatives were returned to power, Morrison was a Bencher (or Master of the Bench) - a senior Inn of Court member - and from October 1951 to 1959 he was Speaker of the House of Commons presiding, for example, over debates on the Suez crisis in 1956. In 1959 he retired from the House and soon afterwards, in November 1959, he was chosen to succeed Sir William (Viscount) Slim as Governor-General of Australia. He was created Viscount Dunrossil of Vallaquie (on the island of North Uist, Outer Hebrides) and appointed G.C.M.G. Morrison had seven brothers: John Morrison, Donald Morrison, Alexander Morrison, Neil Morrison, Donald John Morrison, Cecil John Rhodes Morrison, and Roderick Morrison. In 1965, the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognised the eldest brother, John Morrison of Ruchdi, as chief of clan and name Morrison. Donald Morrison had studied pharmacology and then became a crofter and general merchant in North Uist. Alexander Morrison was a farmer in Canada, but was killed at Loos in 1915. Neil Morrison became a solicitor. Donald John Morrison - called 'Pwe' or 'DJ' - became a GP in Ballantrae, Ayrshire. Cecil John Rhodes Morrison became a doctor, a radiologist, in London. Sadly, Roderick Morrison died in infancy. William Shepherd Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil, died on 3 February 1961 at Government House, Canberra, Australia. After a state funeral, he was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St John the Baptist, Reid, Canberra. His eldest son, John Morrison, succeeded to the viscountcy. His widow, Lady Dunrossil died in England in 1983.

Russell A. Leather was born in 1924. He was educated at George Heriot's School and studied at Edinburgh University from 1948. His university education was delayed by wartime and his army service as a Captain in the Far East with the Royal Corps of Signals, 1942-1947/48. As in other instutions in the UK, studying at Edinburgh University in the immediate post-war period was challenging. Food and clothing were severely rationed and new equipment was in short supply. Test equipment and other mechanical machinery were of pre-war standard, but although out-dated it was capable of producing decent results. Although Leather studied electrical engineering, the first year curriculum was aimed at providing students with a broader engineering background. Mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology were all covered.  In the pre-war period, the emphasis had been on civil engineering but this changed in the late-1940s when, under Professor Arnold, greater emphasis was placed on mechanical engineering. And, later on, under Professor Farvis, an electrical engineering curriculum was developed and this included electronics which, though still hollow state, would soon be dominated by solid state electronics. At Edinburgh University, electrical power engineering relied on equipment at the then Heriot-Watt College. After his studies, Leather worked on and researched into radar with Ferranti in Edinburgh and in Dundee. During his time with Ferranti he took out around 25 patents. Latterly he was Chair of the Gannochy Trust for seventeen years until 2008, and had been a Trustee for 40-years. Russell A. Leather BSc Hon LL.D. CEng. FIEE MIMechE visited Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections, in November 2012 to donate his first and second year engineering note-books.

John Smith Flett was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, on 26 June 1869. He was educated at Kirkwall Burgh School and at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. In 1886 he entered Edinburgh University studying Arts, Science, and Medicine, and was awarded the degree of M.A. at the age of nineteen, the degree of B.Sc. in 1892, and the degrees of M.B. and C.M. (Master in Surgery) in 1894. A brief spell in medical practice followed, before he joined the staff of the Geology Department of Edinburgh University as Assistant to Professor James Geikie (1839-1915), and then as a Lecturer in Petrology. Flett's earliest noteworthy research was his investigations into the stratigraphy of the Old Red Sandstone of Orkney and into the petrography of the alkaline dykes found in that formation. For this Orkney research he was awarded the degree of D.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1900, and that year too he became Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1901, Flett took up the post of Petrographer to the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and acquired a comprehensive knowledge of British rocks. Whilst in post, he collaborated with Dr. Tempest Anderson (1846-1913) in studying the vulcanicity of the Soufriere and Mont Pelee in the West Indies. In 1911 he became Assistant to the Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and during the First World War he was responsible for the supply of geological information required. In 1918, Flett was appointed OBE and was awarded the KBE in 1925. Towards the end of his career, Flett was responsible for the transfer of the Geological Survey to the Geological Museum at South Kensington, in 1935. His published works include a collaborative piece,James Geikie: the man and the geologist(1917) as well asThe first hundred years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1835-1935(1937). Sir John Smith Flett died at Ashdon, in Essex, on 26 January 1947.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on 6 March 1996.

The work of Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute with patented nuclear transfer technology (which included the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 and Polly, a cloned and transgenic sheep, in 1997) opened out a number of possibilities for scientific and medical research. These included the ability to study genetic diseases more effectively in the most appropriate experimental species, to study the basic mechanisms of ageing, to create genetically identical animals for research use, to facilitate the production of novel proteins in livestock and to modify genes in livestock and other experimental animals. These opportunities led to a number of spin-off ventures from Roslin Institute, intended to exploit the commercial, biotechological and medical possibilities of this technology. In 1997, the Institute granted PPL Therapeutics, itself a company established by Roslin, exclusive license to use nuclear transfer technology for the production of therapeutic and medical nutritional proteins in the milk of genetically modified animals - the Institute retained the rights to the jointly owned arising intellectual propert from ongoing research in agricultural and animal breeding areas. In 1998, Roslin created Roslin Bio-Med, a company formed to exploit the cloning technology developed as part of the research which produced Dolly the sheep. In 1999, Roslin Bio-Med was acquired by Geron Corporation.

Charlotte Auerbach arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1933 after being forced to flee Germany and the anti-Semitic laws in place there at the time. Auerbach became best known for her 1941 discovery with J.M. Robson that mustard gas causes mutagenesis. This material was likely gathered together as part of Beale's preparation of his biographical memoir of Auerbach which was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).

Thomas Campbell was born on 27 July 1777 in Glasgow where he went to school showing promise as a poet and an interest in Classics. He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt. They were married in 1914 just after he had been appointed headmaster of the Burgh (now known as the Grammar) School in Kirkwall. During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. His published works include The Orkney Norn (1929), and posthumously Orkney Farm-Names (1952).  Dr Hugh Marwick died in Kirkwall on 21 May 1965.

David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

This is a manuscript common-place book of original lyric verse, from c. 1827-1839, and with numerous pen and ink drawings and watercolours. The poems are mostly of a sentimental religious nature, distinctly rural, and with a few of a topical nature. Topical lines include an opening poem on Napoleon, the death of Canning, the death of the opera-singer Maria Malibran, and one on the accession of Queen Victoria. Some are family orientated and include watercolour portraits - 'Letitia. On her return from Bath 21 Dec. 1837' and 'On Ben's birth day, 12 November 1837'. There is a poem entitled 'Crypt Bells' referring to Gloucester's 'Cloister'd scenes', which together with the reference to Bath may offer a clue to the location of the unknown writer.

John Fraser was born in Tain in 1885. Following his education in Tain he studied at Edinburgh University where he undertook medical graduating with honours in 1907 and gaining the Class Medal in Clinical Surgery.  He served as House Surgeon and Assistant Surgeon to Sir Harold Stiles, both in private practice and at Chalmers Hospital. It was his research with his mentor on bone and joint tuberculosis in children which established his surgical reputation. he succeeded Stiles as the regius Professor of Clinical Surgery in 1927. During the First World War, Fraser served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in France, and was awarded the Military Cross after being wounded in 1916. During his subsequent career, he developed a great interest in cardiac surgery and was the first surgeon in Scotland and only the second in the British Isles to undertake ligation of a patent ductis arteriosis. He received international recognition through the fellowship of various surgical associations and was made honorary fellow of the Royal Australasian and American Colleges of Surgeons. In 1935, he left London for Southampton and on to New York on board the RMS 'Aquitania' setting out on a world tour. He travelled overland to Los Angeles and crossed the Pacific to Honolulu, to Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. During the journey he visited hospitals and delivered lectures. Also in 1935, Fraser was appointed surgeon to His Majesty the King in Scotland. He was made Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1937 and was created a Baronet in 1942. He succeeded Sir Thomas Henry Holland as Principal of Edinburgh University in 1944, and on his untimely death he was succeeded in turn by Sir Edward Victor Appleton in 1948.  Sir John Fraser, Bt. KCVO., MC., MD., Ch.M., LL.D., FRCSE., FACS., and Honorary Surgeon in Scotland to HM the King, had died in 1947.

This manuscript volume records medical case notes of male and female patients of the Edinburgh physicians James Gregory (1753-1821) and Daniel Rutherford (1749-1819) in November 1793. Members of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh volunteered on a monthly rotation to treat the impoverished sick at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and it seems likely that this is a record of clinical cases from the Infirmary. In 1790 the physician James Gregory had been appointed joint Professor of the Practice of Physic at Edinburgh University, augmenting the ageing William Cullen (1710-1790). On the death of Cullen soon afterwards, Gregory went on to hold the Chair alone for the rest of his life. He attacked the system of rotation of doctors to the Royal Infirmary on the grounds that patients were uncertain as to which physicians would treat them, and permanent medical staff were appointed eventually. The physician Daniel Rutherford was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1791. Rutherford was also considered to be one of the leading chemists of his generation. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians between December 1796 and December 1798.

Gaetano Donizetti was born in Bergamo on 29 November 1797. Donizetti was given some musical instruction from a priest who was also the musical director at the main church in Bergamo. As a choirboy though, Donizetti did not shine, but the priest recognised in him a nascent musical ability and managed to have him enrolled at the Liceo Filarmonico - the musical school - in Bergamo. He received training in fugue and counterpoint, and it was at the school that he launched his operatic career. After writing some minor work he went to Naples, then Rome and Milan, and wrote some 31 operas in only twelve years. He became internationally known in 1830 with his  Anna Bolena which was premiered in Milan. Donizetti's most famous work was Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). Gaetano Donizetti died insane on 8 April 1848.  Fausta is a two-act opera by Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian libretto was by Domenico Gilardoni, who died while writing it, and the remainder was written by Donizetti. The opera was given its debut on 12 January 1832 at the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, Italy.

The divine and poet Ralph Erskine was born on 15 March 1685 at Monilaws in Northumberland. He was the sixth son of the Rev. Henry Erskine (1624-1696) by his second wife Margaret Halcro. Henry Erskine had settled in Northumberland in 1684 after a period of imprisonment on the Bass Rock. Ralph Erskine entered Edinburgh University in November 1699 studying an Arts course until 1704. Strongly religious as a child and influenced in young adulthood by the religious conversion of his sister-in-law who had married his brother Ebenezer Erskine (1680-1754), he himself became converted. After University he became tutor to the family of Colonel John Erskine of Culross, and he also pursued theological studies. In 1709 he was licensed by the Dunfermline Presbytery and was ordained in 1711. After a dispute with General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1732, Erskine along with six other ministers formed the Scottish Secession Church with Ebenezer Erskine as their first Moderator. In the late-1730s correspondence was begun between Erskine and George Whitefield (1714-1770) the Anglican cleric and evangelist who had gone to North America. The correspondence led to Whitefield coming to Scotland and his first sermon in Scotland was delivered at Erskine's own church. It wasn't too long before Erskine's Secession Church was torn in two - over the taking of the Civil Oath by Burgesses in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth. The argument was over what was meant in taking that Oath and over what it meant by promising to oppose Catholicism. Those who opposed the Oath withdrew in 1747 and constituted themselves as the General Associate Synod. Ralph Erskine is responsible for the following works: Gospel sonnets published early in his ministry and reaching a 10th edition in 1762 and a 25th in 1797 long after his death; a paraphrase of the Song of Solomon (1738); a version of the Book of Lamentations (1750). Job's hymns was published posthumously in in 1753. His Practical works in two volumes were edited by John Newlands, his son-in-law in 1764-1766. In the 1750s, Erskine developed heart disease and his last sermon was held in late-October 1752. Ralph Erskine died on 6 November 1752, and he was buried in Dunfermline on 9 November.

Ian M. L. Hunter graduated from Edinburgh University in 1950 with a First Class Honours degree in Psychology (B.Sc), and also graduated from Oxford in 1953 with a D.Phil. Between 1953 and 1962 he was a Lecturer in Psychology at Edinburgh University. In 1962 he went to the University of Keele as its foundation Professor of Psychology. He retired early from Keele in 1982, then became Emeritus Professor. In the early 1960s, while Dr. Ian M.L. Hunter, he collaborated with Professor Alexander C. Aitken in investigations about his extraordinary abilities as a mental calculator. They met frequently and also exchanged letters. Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912, and then studied at the University of Otago from 1913. His studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry in Gallipoli and Egypt. Wounded during the Battle of the Somme, Aitken returned to New Zealand in 1917, after hospitalisation. He gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967, and Ian M.L.

Jay Laurence Lush, the pioneering animal geneticist, was born on 3 January 1896 in Shambaugh, Iowa, United States of America. He studied the B.Sc. course in Animal Husbandry at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University, or KSU), and after obtaining the degree in 1916 he was awarded his M.Sc. at KSU in 1918, and then a Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1922. Between 1930 and 1966, Lush was the Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture at Iowa State University, and he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1967. He was awarded the US National Medal of Science in 1968, and the Wolf Prize in 1979. Lush visited Britain and Australia in 1948 on temporary duty with the US Department of State. Lush's influence on animal breeding around the world has been enhanced greatly by the wide distribution of his work Animal Breeding Plans (1937). In addition, his authoritative mimeographed notes, The genetics of populations (1948), have also played a major role in the thinking of animal breeders. Professor Jay L. Lush died on 22 May 1982.

J. L. Levison lived for a time in Hull, England. He was the author of Mental culture, or, The means of developing the human faculties, published in 1883, and printed for Levison and sold by Jackson and Walford, London, and also of Practical observations on the teeth and gums with the best means for their preservation published in 1838 by Longman, London.  George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788, the son of a brewer. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in the Edinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

These notes relate to Beale's work on intragenic recombination among the antigen-determining genes in Paramecium. Beale constructed heterozygotes involving various combinations of different 'd' antigen alleles, passed them through autogamy and screened the progeny with sera capable of immobilising the parental types. Theoretically intragenic recombinants should have appeared, but the only novel types Beale got turned out to be 'nuls' - i.e. cells unable to express any antigen controlled by the locus corresponding to the original types used.

George McDonald Sutherland was born in 1886, the son of a master-mason George P. Sutherland. This elder Sutherland, educated at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, had served as an apprentice sculptor in Edinburgh, London and New York, and in 1881 had founded the firm of George Sutherland and Sons (Galashiels), Sculptors and Monumental Masons. The firm operated throughout the Borders over the next 100 years, with war memorials and grave stones comprising a large part of the business, and ran additional businesses in Hawick and in Tweedmouth. The carvings on the local Galashiels Post Office building were created by Sutherland in 1886. The younger George McDonald Sutherland had been apprenticed as a young architect to the firm of Sir Robert Lorimer in 1903, at the age of 17. He subsequently went to Toronto, Canada, to start an architectural business and bought land there too. On the outbreak of the Great War however, he came back to Scotland to enlist and joined the 4th King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB). Sadly he was killed at Arras on 9 April 1917 and was buried there.

The Scottish zoologist and chief scientist on the 'Challenger' expedition Charles Wyville Thomson was born at Bonsyde in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830. He was the son of a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company, and was baptized Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School and then he studied at Edinburgh University. In 1850 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at Kings College, Aberdeen, and then Professor of Botany at Marischal College, Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a Professor of Natural History in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at the Queen's University of Belfast, and in 1860 was transferred to the Chair of Natural History at the same institution.  In 1868 he assumed the duties of Professor of Botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh University. Wyville Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of dredgings in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS Lightning and HMS Porcupine for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. These researches showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in his work The Depths of the Sea. The results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of HMS Challenger for a global expedition. He was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872. The Challenger Expedition would be deemed a great success, and on his return Wyville Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he was also created a Knight of the Polar Star on a visit to Sweden. Thomson's published work includes The Depths of the Sea (1873) and The Voyage of the Challenger in the Atlantic (1880). Professor Sir Charles Wyville Thomson died at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882.

The poet, Tom Scott, was born in Glasgow on 6 June 1918. He was the son of a Clydeside boilermaker. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the family moved from Glasgow to St. Andrews where an uncle of Tom had a stonemason's business. After a brief apprenticeship to a butcher, Tom became an apprentice stonemason. His poetic spirit first manifested itself in his singing voice (described variously as tenor, or bass). During the Second World War, although a pacifist, he contributed to the war effort - believing that fascism had to be fought against - through his service in the Pay Corps. It was at this time he began to write poetry. Scott's earlier work was in English, and after the war, settling in London, his circle included Kathleen Raine, and Dylan Thomas. Visits to Europe encouraged his Scots poetic voice and he translated the 15th century work of the French poet Villon into Scots. Other work includedSea dirge,The ship,The tree,The dity business, andBrand the builder. In 1966 he completed a Ph.D on the work of William Dunbar which appeared as a book, and he editedThe Penguin book of Scottish verse(1970). In 1963, Scott had married Heather Fretwell and they wrote children's books. Their home was in the Portobello district of Edinburgh. In the 1980s, he contracted myeloma, a rare form of leukaemia, but he survived this. Tom Scott died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 7 August 1995.

Until the mid-19th century, broadsides provided the sort of information provided by modern tabloids. They tended to be single sheets of paper, unfolded, and printed on one side. Designed to be posted up in public places, broadsides were used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices, and later on became a means of political agitation. Edinburgh's 'baillies', the officials responsible for this notice or broadside, were the city's magistrates who had administrative and judicial powers. In Scotland the office of 'baillie', also spelled 'bailie', emerged in the 14th century. Since 1975, the title has largely become a courtesy one. Those baillies present when this ordinance was issued in Edinburgh in November 1720 were: John Wightman, George Preston, Robert Grierson, and Hugh Hathorn. They were present as Baillies and Justices of His Majesty's Peace. The ordinance was intended to restrain the soldiers of the City Guard from the 'immoral practices of Cursing and Swearing'. Those who were caught would be fined one penny and the money put into the poor box.

The Museum of Scotland, part of the National Museums of Scotland, was designed by the architects Benson and Forsyth. The firm had been selected as winners of an archictectural competition in 1991. The design received inspiration from Scotland's national building tradition, evoking the idea of castle, broch, tower house, and tenement. Materials used include external cladding of golden Clashach sandstone from Morayshire, and concrete, limestone, beech, and smooth plaster in the interior of the building. A roof-top garden offers views of Edinburgh Castle , Greyfriars Kirk, the Scott Monument, the city skyline generally, the sea, and the hills. The Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, was the first national museum project in the UK since the mid-19th century and it was opened by the Queen in November 1998. Professor Michael Lynch, Edinburgh University, was appointed as a consultant to the Exhibition Review Committee (ERC) which oversaw the planning of the building and the devising of the content.

Carnegie Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training opened in Dunfermline on the 4th October 1905. The Andrew Carnegie Trust founded it as a training college for women students of Physical Education. In 1908 the college was opened to men and in 1909 it was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as a central institution for the purpose of the Education (Scotland) Act 1908. Between 1913-14 new accommodation were built, and the college was renamed Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Education (DCHPE). From 1931 only women students were trained at DCHPE - the male students being transferred to Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow. Between 1939-46 the staff and students of the college were temporarily transferred to the Teachers Training Centre in Aberdeen, its buildings being commandeered by the navy during World War II. In 1950 the College transferred to Woolmanhill, Aberdeen, due to over-crowding problems at the other site. Hygiene was then dropped from the name of the college and the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust severed connections since the College was no longer based in Dunfermline. A Board of Governors was established for the College in 1959, and in 1966 the College (now just DCPE) transferred to newly built specialist accommodation at Cramond, Edinburgh. In 1986 it was announced that the training of physical education teachers - male and female - would be centralised at Cramond. In 1987 DCPE merged with Moray House College of Education and the male students then at Jordanhill College transferred to the enlarged Moray House at the same time. The combined expertise provided the core of the Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies (SCOPEMALS) at Moray House, Cramond Campus. In 1998 Moray House Institute of Education together with its Cramond Campus became the Faculty of Education of the University of Edinburgh. The University closed the Cramond Campus over the summer of 2001 and the students, staff and facilities relocated to the refurbished St Leonard's Land at Holyrood, part of The Moray House School of Education of the University. During the period at Cramond, one of the students there in the late-1960s was Diana Kerr Hastings.  Diana Kerr Hastings was born in Argyll in 1949, and moved to Angus aged 6. Between 1967 and 1970 she studied at Dunfermline College of Physical Education (DCPE), Cramond. This was at a time when students were expected to take up in-house accommodation in their 1st year, could take approved lodgings in their 2nd year, and had the choice of being resident or non-resident (being 'in' or 'out') in their 3rd year . Some students too began to flat-share, but this had to be with other DCPE students and even then, as Mrs Hastings has noted 'even those pioneers of indepndent living were told they would not be allowed into sick bay if they were ill'. During her three year course she represented the College in athletics, badminton, lacrosse, netball and orienteering. She was also the College netball secretary and she went on to serve as Liaison Officer for Scottish Netball when they played their Home International matches at Meadowbank, Edinburgh, in the 1970s. In 1970, she graduated from DCPE with the Diploma of Physical Education, with Merit in Professional Subjects. Between 1970 and 1972 she taught in Kirriemuir, Angus, and later on moved back to Edinburgh and taught at St. Giles School for the Hearing Impaired until 1976. From 1992 she retrained in Paediatric Audiology working initially in Lothian Region schools, and then for the NHS until her retirement in June 2009. In 2010, Diana Kerr Hastings attended a 40th Anniversary gathering of graduating students (from the 1967-1970 course).

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. As an invention which could separate male- and female- determining spermatozoa was potentially of wider commercial interest, a patent was applied for by Beatty to protect this work (known as 'Control of Sex Ratio in Mammalian Offspring') before Hancock submitted his results for publication. In 1976, funding was also received from the Scottish Milk Marketing Board to determine whether the sex-ratio control method could be applicable in cattle. A United States Patent Application was also put forward in 1977.

This unpublished report by Professor Emmett L. Bennett Jr. is of the proceedings of a conference held in Wisconsin in 1961, called the Mycenaean Colloquium. The distinguished Classics scholar, Emmett L. Bennett, born in Minnesota in 1918. Bennett is the founding father of the study of Mycenaean scripts. The focus of his life work was the discovery in 1939 of hundreds of Linear B tablets in Pylos, Greece, by the American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887-1971) with whom he had worked while earning his Ph.D. at McMicken College of Arts and Sciences, University of Cincinnati. Bennett edited and analysed the primary inscriptions of the pre-alphabetic syllabic script, Linear B, and to do this he used the same skills he had employed as a cryptographer during World War II.

James D. Macgregor was born in Invergowrie, near Dundee, on 21 August 1927. He was the son of Margaret (Robertson) and Alexander Macgregor. His father was Headmaster of the local school, Invergowrie Public School, the school attended by Macgregor until the age of ten. His secondary schooling was at Perth Academy. Between 1945 and 1950 he studied at St. Andrews University where he graduated with the degree of MBChB. After graduation, Macgregor worked in general practice in Perth and Bridge of Earn before becoming House Physician at Perth Royal Infirmary. In 1951, he was appointed as House Surgeon at the Royal Northern Infirmary in Inverness. Prior to his 'call up' to National Service he was serving at Scartho Infirmary (Grimsby District General Hospital) in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire, England. At this point, he joined the Colonial Medical Service and towards the end of 1951 he began a first tour of duty in Freetown, Sierra Leone (know then as the Sierra Leone Protectorate), at the Connaught Hospital there. By the age of 25 Macgregor had become Assistant Surgeon at the hospital. He also ran the Mental Hospital at Kissy which, even in 2006, is the only psychiatric facility in Sierra Leone. This first tour of duty lasted until March 1953. Macgregor's second tour of duty began with his appointment as District Medical Officer for Makeni District at its population of some 360,000 most of whom were spread over a very wide area. Assisting him were two doctors and an American missionary. This second tour lasted until the end of 1954 when he joined the Colonial Service as a permanent and pensionable officer. In April 1955, Macgregor married a student from Edinburgh and the couple then travelled back to Freetown where he was to serve at the Hill Station Hospital (now called Choithrams Hospital). In 1956 he was posted to Magburaka in the Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone and to a new hospital there. Promotion followed, and Macgregor was posted to the Solomon Islands (then known as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate) as Senior Medical Officer. The journey to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, on Guadalcanal, took two months by an Orient Line vessel - SS Oronsay - to Sydney, then tramp steamer. While on the Solomon Islands three children were born to the family. In 1975 Macgregor returned to the UK with his family to take up an appointment as Chief Medical Officer for the Shetland Islands - the Shetland Health Board. In 1981 he became District Medical Officer in Perth - Tayside Health Board. He retired in 1993. In retirement he has acted as secretary for a variety of bodies and has also been Medical Officer for Tayside Fire Brigade and for Fife Fire and Rescue Service.

Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.

The mineralogist Robert Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774. His early education was received in Leith and then he became the apprentice of a surgeon in Leith, with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at Edinburgh University, studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. By 1793, and influenced by the Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731-1803), he abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's museum. In 1793, he went to London, meeting naturalists and visiting museums to take notes. A visit to the Shetland Islands followed in 1794, to explore the geology, mineralogy, zoology and botany there. This led to the publication of The mineralogy of the Shetland Islands and of Arran, with an appendix containing observations on peat, kelp, and coal (1798). Earlier, in 1796, Jameson read two papers rejecting the vulcanist interpretation of the formation of Earth that had been put forward by Edinburgh geologist James Hutton (1726-1797). Hutton had propounded the theory that the features of the Earth's crust were caused by natural processes over geologic time; the principle of uniformitarianism. Instead, Jameson supported the ideas of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) who had proclaimed the aqueous origin of rocks; that rocks were formed when immense quantities of minerals precipitated out of the waters of the biblical flood.Other visits to the Scottish islands in the north and west, and to Ireland, produced the two volume Mineralogy of the Scottish isles (1800) which was a fuller description of his views. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiburg, Saxony, to study under Werner. He returned to Edinburgh in 1802.  On the death of Walker in 1803, Jameson was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Keeper of the University Museum. Over his fifty year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum, including fossils, birds and insects. Although he had been one of the great exponents of Werner's geological tenets and founded the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808, Jameson afterwards admitted conversion to the views of Hutton. He died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1854. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum (now Royal Museum) in Edinburgh's Chambers Street.

In the 17th century, glass slides were already being projected using a 'magic lantern' - or early form of the projector. However, in 1850, in Philadelphia, USA, the transparent positive image of a photograph in the form of a glass slide was invented by William and Frederick Langenheim - two Daguerreotypists. Their 'hyalotype' (from Greek 'hyalo' for glass) or black and white photographic glass slide could be projected onto a wall or screen using a 'magic lantern' lit by oil lamps. By 1870, limelight - a dazzling white light produced by directing a very hot flame onto the surface of a pellet of lime - offered a better, although more dangerous, form of illumination. The earliest and simplest form of limelight was the oxy-calcium lamp. The flame of a spirit lamp was placed near the pellet of lime and a jet of oxygen was used to raise the temperature of the flame and force it against the surface of the lime to produce its brilliant white light. An even brighter limelight could be produced using an oxygen and hydrogen jet. In the 1890s, the invention of the carbon arc lamp, followed by electric light, provided a safe method for displaying the lantern slide image. By 1873, Bruno Meyer, a German art historian at the Polytechnic Institute in Karlsruhe, was using projected lantern slides in art history lectures, and actually started to manufacture what he called 'glasphotogramme' which he sold at two marks a piece. When the new electric 'magic lantern' projectors were introduced in 1892, the technology was enthusiastically adopted by Hermann Grimm, a professor of art history at the University of Berlin. In an article published in 1897, he reported how lantern slides permitted the projection of works full-size, or allowed small works or fragments to be enlarged to colossal scale. Grimm's successor at Berlin was Heinrich Wölfflin who also embraced the new technology In 1916, a process for producing colour lantern slides had been invented by the German company Agfa, but because of the war it did not become available outside Germany until the 1920s. Use of lantern slides lasted until the 1950s when their popularity began to decline with the introduction of smaller transparencies and then, finally, in 1936, the discovery of the Kodachrome three-color process made the 35mm format slides less expensive to produce than lantern slides. Beginning in 1938, the transparencies were presented in the now familiar card mounts. Although the production of lantern slides ended in the 1950s, many academic slide collections still house and use glass slides. In some cases, the views that they represent are either drastically changed or no longer exist and thus they are invaluable images of the world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Hugh Blair FRSE (7 April 1718–27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse. As a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair's teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for Sermons, a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment  Blair's publishers were Thomas Becket or Beckett and Peter Abraham De Hondt James Macpherson was a Scottish writer, poet, literary collector and politician, known as the 'translator' of the Ossian cycle of poems. He was born on 27 October 1736. Blair had arranged the publication of Macpherson's Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland in 1760, and it was Macpherson's Fingal of 1761 that prompted Blair to deliver the lectures that he expanded into A critical dissertation on the poems of Ossian, the son of Fingal published by Becket and De Hondt in London. The same publisher brought out Macpherson's second and final Ossianic epic Temora. James Macpherson died 17 February 1796.

Edward Bald Jamieson, from Shetland, was a graduate of Edinburgh University (1900), and then demonstrator and lecturer in Anatomy at Edinburgh University. He was also an author of medical textbooks on Anatomy. William Rolland Scott Cowe was born on 24 October 1915 in Edinburgh. He studied at Edinburgh University and was awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery, MB., Ch.B. on 20 July 1938. Still resident in Edinburgh in 1939, he was Obstetric House Surgeon at the Simpson Memorial Pavilion, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. His career then took him to Wigan, Lancashire, as House Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary there. In Keighley, Yorkshire, he served as the Police Surgeon, Keighley Division, West Riding Constabulary, and was a Clinical Assistant (Venereology) at Airedale General Hospital.  During the Second World War he served as a Captain and then Major with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Africa and Palestine. Cowe's prime interest was obstetrics and gynaecology and he became a member of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh with a presentation on Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy, January 1939. He went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Medical Society. In his specialism of veneorology, publications include the jointly written 'Penicillin in gonnorhea and syphilus' in the British Medical Journal in 1945, and 'Middle East granuloma' in the British Journal of Venereal Diseases also in 1945.  William Rolland Scott Cowe retired to Kirk Yetholm, Roxburghshire, in the Scottish Borders, and he died there on 15 December 1986 .

The Scottish poet Sorley MacLean was born in Oscaig, Raasay, on 26 October 1911. He was educated locally and then at Portree High School. He studied English Literature at Edinburgh University from 1929, graduating in 1933 with a First. MacLean then began a teaching career, starting in Portree after qualifying from Moray House (teacher training college). Briefly between 1937-1938 he taught at Tobermoray Secondary School before returning to Edinburgh in 1939 to the English Department of Boroughmuir High School. In 1940, MacLean joined the Signals Corps and was posted to North Africa. He was seriously wounded at El Alamein in November 1942, and was invalided home to Scotland. He returned to his teaching post at Boroughmuir in 1943. In 1946 he married Renee Cameron. Although their life seemed settled in Edinburgh, and Sorley had been drawn into the literary circle of Douglas Young and his associates, which included George Campbell Hay, Norman McCaig, and especially Robert Garioch (Alastair Sutherland), he accepted the appointment of Headmaster at Plockton High School in 1956. MacLean's output included Seventeen Poems for Six-pence (with Garioch, 1940), Dain do Eimhir (1943), and co-authorship of Four Points of a Saltire (1970). He retired as Headmaster at Plockton in 1972 but then found himself drawn into a new educational experience, first as the Creative Writing Fellow at Edinburgh University (1973-5) and then as Filidh ('Poet') at the then embryonic Gaelic College at Sabhal Mor Ostaig (1975-6). Sorley MacLean died in Inverness on 24 November 1996.

The Scottish Musical Society was established in Edinburgh in 1879 at a meeting "of gentlemen present" on 22 October to discuss "Dr Donaldson's scheme for the formation of a Society for Musical Education". The objects of the Society were "to foster, encourage and aid musical ability in the attainment of high vocal or instrumental excellence, and of eminence in musical composition". "Scotland has no means of giving the highest musical education, and Scotland has no resident orchestra". On these two facts was based the necessity for an Association such as the Scottish Musical Society. The Society "will endeavour in every possible way to encourage the study of music and to render the profession of music dignified and honourable". A number of Scottish noblemen became Vice-Presidents of the Society and Professor Sir Herbert Stanley Oakeley, Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh was a Vice-President, ex-officio. The Council of the Society comprised Advocates, Lawyers and Sheriffs, University Professors, Merchants, Manufacturers, Writers and Stockbrokers from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Dundee. The objects of the Society were seen to be of "great national importance" and the Council were confident of "that support which is necessary to render its operations a complete success". The President of the Society, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry and the Chairman of the Council, The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Rosebery, each promised an initial donation of £500, however, this was just a promise and the money never actually changed hands. The ambitions of the Society were to raise £3000, to found an Academy of Music in Edinburgh, to offer a musical education for Scottish students. They were keen to establish an orchestra of local musicians and that pupils from the new Academy would be drafted into it to encourage and train native musicians in the great masterpieces of orchestral music. Sufficient funds were never achieved. In 1887 the suggestion was made that the Society should consider the "advisability of linking themselves and their academy … to the system of musical graduation … in the University of Edinburgh". The opportunity for this link came in 1890 with the proposed reforms in the administration of the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh being reviewed by the Scottish Universities Commission. At a meeting on 10 February 1890, it was resolved that the Society should formulate a scheme for musical education, to be submitted to the commissioners, which would more adequately reflect "the intentions of General Reid and the musical conditions of the time". The Academy of Music for Scotland as envisaged by the founders of the Society never opened and despite attracting interest from across Europe for a conductor for a resident orchestra in Scotland this ambition was overtaken by events and the establishment in 1891 of the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow. In 1900, "having accomplished all that is possible with the means at its disposal" the Society was would up by voluntary liquidation. The committee advised that, "the balance in the hands of the liquidator" be expended in the purchase of books for presentation to the University of Edinburgh for the purposes of the Music Class Room library in connection with the Reid Chair of Music. The three important legacies of the Society were the raising of awareness of the lack of facilities for music education in Scotland, their contributions to the reorganisation of the Reid Chair of Music and the establishment of the Faculty of Music in 1893-94 and the purchase of books and scores for the Reid Music Library, in the University of Edinburgh.

Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

Bruce Henderson Kenrick, clergyman and housing campaigner, was born 18 January 1920 in Aintree, Liverpool, the son of an accountant. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School in Crosby. During the Second World War he served with the Army Medical Corps in West Africa - in the Gold Coast, now Ghana - and then with the Eighth Army and the Parachute Brigade in Italy. After the war he began studies in Medicine at Edinburgh University but during his studies he became involved with the Christian Union which led to his switching courses to Theology. He was awarded the degree of B.D. on 9 July 1954. Also in 1954, Kenrick married Isabel Witte, a Bostonian. After his ordination as a Presbyterian minister in 1961 - the Church of Scotland - he continued his studies at Princeton Theological Seminary and joined the ecumenical ministry of the East Harlem Protestant Parish (EHPP) which was involved in promoting a Christian response to rising racial tensions. Between 1956 and 1959, Kenrick served as a missionary in Bengal - in Calcutta - where he and his wife supported local movements for land reform. However, when he contracted typhoid in India they returned to the UK. The family then moved to Iona in the west of Scotland where he had become a member of the Iona Community - an ecumenical community created by the Rev. George MacLeod in 1938. Between 1962 and 1980 the Kenricks were in Notting Hill, London, where he worked with an ecumenical group ministry modelled on the EHPP. In 1963, while in Notting Hill, he established the Notting Hill Housing Trust after becoming appalled at the housing conditions in the area Kenrick's work in Notting Hill inspired him to found the housing charity Shelter which was launched in 1966 as a national campaigning body for housing. The charity was given a huge boost by the public outcry after the BBC screening of the Ken Loach film Cathy come home. Kenrick was then able to persuade the Labour government of Harold Wilson to introduce legislation to provide funding for housing associations to enable them to buy and renovate run-down properties, and also for a rent rebate scheme for poorer tenants. In 1980, Kenrick was appointed as a minister in the United Reformed Church in Bayswater. Later still, he moved to another ministry in Hackney before retiring to Iona where he often served as a locum minister. Prior to that, in 1983, he became divorced from his wife. Kenrick's publication record includes The new humanity (1956), Come out the wilderness (1962) which was his account of his experience with the EHPP, and which carried a foreword written by the Rev. Trevor Huddleston, and A man from the interior (1980) which was written after a visit to Cuba and in which he argued that Communism and Christianity could co-exist. The Rev. Bruce Henderson Kenrick died 15 January 2007 in Oban, aged 86.

The ornamental turner Charles Holtzapffel was born in 1806. He was the son of the German engineer John Jacob Holtzapffel (1768-1835), from Alsace, who had settled in London in the 1780s and who had founded the tool business in the 1790s. Trading as John Holtzapffel in London's Long Acre, the firm was noted for its production of iron-bedded lathes with ornamental turning apparatus. In 1804 the firm was expanded to include John George Deyerlein but this arrangement lasted only until 1827. In 1827, Charles Holtzapffel joined the firm at the age of 21. The younger Holtzapffel had received a good English education, and through careful training in the firm's workshop he had become a skilled engineer in his own right. On the death of his father, Charles carried on the firm and continued to develop the machinery and attachments for ornamental turnery. Other devices were invented too, including machinery for printing banknotes, a dividing engine for the graduation of drawing scales, and an apparatus for tracing geometrical figures on glass. In 1838, Charles published hisNew system of scales of equal parts applicable to various purposes of engineering, architecture and general sciencefollowed by its complement, theList of scales of equal parts. In 1843, he publishedTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 1: Materials, their choice, preparation and various modes of working them. This was actually his father's work and was followed in 1846 by his ownTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 2: Construction, action, and application of cutting tools. By 1884, five volumes of this turner's bible had been published by Charles and his son John Jacob Holtzapffel II. Charles Holtzapffel was a member of the Council of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was Chairman of the Mechanic's Committee of the Society of Arts. He died on 11 April 1847 and his widow Amelia Vaux (Dutton) Holtzapffel managed the firm until 1853. Their son John Jacob became head of the firm in 1867 and managed the business until 1896 when Charles' nephew George William Budd (later known as George William Holtzapffel) took over. John Jacob Holtzapffel II died in Eastbourne on 14 October 1897. In 1919, Colonel John George Holtzapffel Budd, the son of George William Holtzapffel, began to take an active part in running the firm.

William Baird possibly had an association with Dysart in Fife, Scotland, in the seventeenth century. Within the manuscript, in its first part, there are a number of clues that supply a date to his life and indicate the Scottish origin of the item. Under an explanation of the Dominical Letter system for discovering the day of the week corresponding to any date is included a mnemonic beginning, 'At Dysart dwells George Bronn Esquire'. The inclusion of this mnemonic suggests that Baird was engaged in teaching mathematics to others and that he was doing so in Scotland. In addition to the reference to Dysart, there is also mention of Scottish money - 'Lib Scotts' - and a date of 1676 is supplied in another calculation. Dysart is a small town on the River Forth, on the northern shore of its large estuary. Dating from the 13th century, the town established itself in the middle of the 15th century as a trading port, exporting salt and coal to the Low Countries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. It had been towards the end of the 16th century that the first coal pit in the town was sunk - known as Lady Blanche. By the middle of the 17th century when coal began to surpass the salt trade, two new pits followed - Frances and Randolph. Two hundred years later, in 2009, there was no coal trade and no salt trade, and the community was a suburb of Kirkcaldy.

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project – not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a £5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

In 1935 Leon Trotsky was invited by Edinburgh University students to become a candidate in the Rectorial election that year. Trotsky had been a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and was second only to Lenin in the early stage of Soviet communist rule. However, he lost out to Stalin in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death. It was Viscount Allenby of Megiddo who went on to become the Edinburgh University Rector in 1935, though he died very suddenly in London the following year from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm - on 14 May 1936. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson then stepped up us Rector. Just a year after the invitation from Edinburgh students, in 1936, Trotsky settled in Mexico. But, on 20 August 1940, acting on the orders of Stalin, Ramon Mercader attacked Trotsky with an ice pick and he died the next day.

The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829. He renewed his contact with the composer later in Berlin and elsewhere on the continent, also making the acquaintance of Schumann.

Geoffrey McKay Gibbon was born in Scarborough on 16 July 1896. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and obtained the degrees of M.B., Ch.B. in 1920. He was registered in Scotland on 8 July 1920. In the 1920s he was living in Elgin and Forres in Scotland, but in the early 1930s he was in Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire, England. It was at this point in his career that when requested by the Registrar of the General Medical Council (Scottish Branch) for notification of any changes to his qualifications, Gibbon's wife informed the Registrar that in September 1931 her husband 'was appointed Surgeon to the R.R.S. 'Discovery II' ' and that he would be absent from the UK for 2-years. The Royal Research Ship 'Discovery II', which had been built in 1929, had sailed from London with Gibbon on board on 3 October 1931 on its second Antarctic commission. The purpose of the expedition was research into the economic resources of the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies in the southern ocean, and more particularly into the most important of these resources at the time: the whale populations and the whaling industry of the waters of the latter, and beyond. The ship had been under the command of Lieut. A. L. Nelson R.N.R. and Comdr. W. M. Carey R.N. (retired), and surveyed from the Magellan Strait to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and then in the oceans around South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. By 1934 Gibbon was working for the Cyprus Medical Service, and in the 1940s he was with the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda. In 1954, the Medical register indicated that he was residing in the Port Elizabeth area of South Africa. Latterly, in the early-1960s (1962), Gibbon lived in Lympstone, Devon. His name ceased to appear in the Medical register after 1983.

The University of Malawi opened in 1964-1965 and the academic, poet, writer, journalist, essayist and publisher Professor Steve Bernard Miles Chimombo (b. 1945) had an association with it from 1972 until 2002 when he retired. Chimombo was among the original first known writers from Chancellor College at Zomba near Blantyre, part of the University of Malawi. He was involved in the creative writing magazineOdi. His work includes theNapolo Poemsand the playThe rain-maker. Another early writer at Chancellor College was the poet Jack Mapanje (b. 1944) who had grown up in the newly independent Malawi under the dictatorship of Dr. Hastings Banda. He was a founding member of the Malawi Writers' Group (or Writers Workshop) which was formed in April 1970 in a deliberate attempt to build a Malawian written literature. The Group met weekly at the College and provided its members with a sympathetic audience for their own poems and stories. Through the groups' gatherings they succeeded in avoiding the control of the official government censor. Though the Group was confined to Chancellor College, it attracted contributions from journalists, teachers and businessmen. The Group became the only forum in which Malawian affairs were freely discussed. Mapanje became a Lecturer in English at the College in 1975, and he published his first collection of poems in London in 1981 -Of chameleons and gods. In 1987, by which time he had become Head of the Department of English, he was detained by police acting for Malawi Special Branch and remained in detention at Mikuyu Maximum Security Detention Centre for three and half years without trial. His poems inThe Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison(1993) were composed while he was imprisoned, as well as most of his third collection of poetry,Skipping without Ropes(1998). More recently he taught a degree course at the University of Leeds, 1993-96, in England, and has been teaching as a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle also in England.

Some of these notes refer to Beale's 'metagon' theory, which postulated that certain genes might liberate in the cytoplasm of Paramecia invisible entities called 'metagons' which control the ability of the cell to permit growth of visible endosymbiotic 'mu' (mate-killer) particles. Beale's key paper about the metagon was published in collaboration with Ian Gibson in 1962. Ultimately, however, it had to be abandoned, because Beale was unable to discover any consistent results from later experiments. 'Kappa' and 'Lambda' refer to certain symbionts of Paramecium.

In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

|
Thomson outlines how the lecturer can gain, maintain, and regain the interest of their students. Drawing parallels with musical composition and form, he covers topics such as including building up anticipation through the use of foreshadowing, matching the pace of the lecture to pupils' skill levels, and presenting new aspects of mundane topics.  Thomson outlines the importance of an introductory section to engage students' attention and set the tone of the lesson.
|
Thomson acknowledges receipt of Kelley's book, Crossroads in the Minds of Man. He advises Ledermann with regards to referencing Kelley's pentad criterion in his paper, while still recognising Ledermann's shorter method for arriving at the same result.  Thomson cites Psychometrika as the best publication for the paper, and offers to send it there if Ledermann is in agreement.
|
Thomson has marked an article regarding a conference titled Methods in Medical Training.
|
Thomson outlines the problems and difficulties in Educational research, and how these can be resolved. These include the difficulty of selecting a representative group (the selection fallacy) and the importance of using suitable control groups in experimental work. Thomson also discusses the difficulty of co-operation with schools, particularly state or public schools, and the need for resources to be dedicated to research.  He expounds upon the usefulness of correlational studies and objective measures in educational research, illustrating his points with examples from studies conducted by international researchers, particularly within the USA.  He discusses how researchers should be trained, stressing the need for them to have a working creed or philosophy of education, and some training in statistical analysis. He also emphasises the need for careful planning and publication of results.

|
The lecture outlines how science can fulfil its main purpose, in Thomson's opinion, that of uniting society. Thomson describes his own education – both formal and informal – and his current role as a lecturer in education, and explains how these have informed his beliefs regarding scientific training.  He makes the case that science has often operated in isolation both from the world around it, and from the native language of its practitioners, with science students dependant on the language of symbols and formulae and incapable, or unwilling, to render their ideas into English.  He stresses the importance that science should be taught in such a way as to enable the student to see its relevance to the wider world and to culture; and the importance that students are not taught to simply accept hypothesis and formula without understanding or questioning.

Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.

Thomson compares the American high school system to the English secondary school system. He argues that there is much to be learned from the American system which, as a result of offering a free education up to 18 for all who wish it and are able, relies on a more varied curriculum which incorporates social and vocational education alongside more academic subjects such as English, Mathematics, classics and science. Thomson reasons that more provision should be made in England for average students who wish to learn vocational subjects. He makes a case for a school model similar to that of America. However, rather than having students of different ability in the same schools, which he argues lowers existing standards, he proposes new schools should be created for the purpose of teaching more social and vocational subjects as in America He also discusses the finance of education – both secondary schools and universities – in America, with particular reference to variation between States; the fact of compulsory military training at some free State universities and private schools; and the American technique of "work-study-play" or platoon schools, in which children change activity and location throughout the school day.

well as rebinding. In folder 'Kennedy-Fraser Mss. D.18377 [E60/25]',
several of the notation sheets in envelope 'Marjory Kennedy-Fraser music notation

Fragile or loose items either protected and supported with acid free sheets and plastic clips or put into separate new archive envelopes.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters

This undated letter from John Donaldson to H. H. Dibdin, and written from Marchfield, discusses the adjustment and tuning of an organ, and denies that Sir George Clerk had advocated 'the absurd perfect third system' stating, 'Until the valves were equally opened it was quite impossible to know, precisely, what kind of temperament Mr. Hill had adopted for the Music Hall organ. When I tried it with Sir G. Clerk we found one stop in tolerable tune - I say tolerable, but even in that stop many of the octaves were out of tune rendering it impossible to do more than conjecture as to the temperament intended'. Donaldson goes on to suggest that Hill would be the right person to carry out any alterations to the instrument, and comments on attitudes to equal temperament.

The collection is composed of three bound volumes being Sir John Fraser's journal of a tour made around the world in 1935. Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates.

Thomson defends examinations, discussing their impartiality, fairness, and showing their importance in a democratic society where individuals progress by merit rather than nepotism. Additionally, Thomson also acknowledges the problems of examinations – namely nerves; chance and luck; time pressures on both examinees and examiners; and the inconsistent relationship between examination performance, the school record, and teachers' own ratings. He discusses possible solutions to these problems, citing the marking of the eleven-plus examination in Darlington and Brighton respectively as solutions to the latter. Thomson also touches briefly on the processes involved in making a test.

Thomson outlines his ideals for educational research, which he feels is at its best when conducted by an individual investigating fundamental educational problems. He acknowledges that modern research is in reality constrained by input from collaborators or funders. Thomson discusses how research bodies such as the National Foundation and the Scottish Council for Research in Education can help the researcher in a variety of ways, including not limiting the researcher with too many or too exacting instructions, not demanding too quick a return, and involving the researcher in the design of experiments. He explores team work and co-operation, giving the Scottish Mental Surveys as an example, and emphasises the importance of strong, inspirational, and collaborative leadership. He also discusses the responsibilities of the researcher undertaking individual research, including the design of experiments and the utilising of research tools such as statistics; and the supposed dichotomy of fundamental and operational research. The lecture is written on the reverse side of headed paper from the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology. Edinburgh, 23rd July-29th July.

Thomson discusses the need for education to benefit both the individual and the wider community (or civilisation). He defines intelligence and intelligence testing, and compares the Scottish and English systems to each other and to America. Ultimately, he argues that schools should contain a mixture of intelligence levels, with education catered to each child, which will in turn create a unified society.

The lecture regards the problem of propaganda in school. Thomson defines what he sees as propaganda and its methods, and discusses whether teachers, who have an advantage over their less mature students, can avoid propaganda, and if so, how. He gives a few examples of controversial subjects that should or should not be covered in school. The lecture is on the one side of the manuscript, with the other containing a typescript of an incomplete poem regarding education and scholarship (it is unclear whether this was written by Thomson or copied); and a quotation from Bertrand Russell's Analysis of Matter with Thomson's comments.

Thomson defines educational science, which he sees as having two facets: operational, such as the research undertaken by the Scottish Council for Research in Education regarding the best teaching methods; and fundamental, such as research undertaken to explore the sources of intelligence differences, and their relationship to one another. Thomson charts how educational science has progressed, due in part to the use of mathematical statistics and the increasing use of quantitative measurements. He cites the application of statistical tests to the results of educational experiments to determine their significance as an example. Thomson looks closely at the issue of nature versus nurture, making particular reference to the Scottish Mental Surveys, and studies carried out on siblings and twins. He talks about both the usefulness and limitations of intelligence testing, and the possibilities of factor analysis in identifying the different abilities within an individual's mind. He describes some issues he thinks are worthy of investigation by educational science, including the notion of transfer beyond school, selection for secondary school and further education, techniques for memorising in the classroom, and propaganda in the classroom.

The junction of Potterrow (right) looking approximately north, and Bristo Street (left of print) looking northwest. The street, with its eighteenth century buildings, had close associations with Robert Burns. Potterrow, to the right, was a less important thoroughfare, being narrower. In the centre of the picture, at the 'V' formed by the two streets, is an eighteenth century mansion nicknamed the "Ace of Clubs House" because of its distinctive shape; for many years it was a public house. The site of all this area is now Charles Street Car Park, and the wide Potterrow.

The lecture comprises of Thomson's advice to new and inexperienced lecturers, and covers topics such as the audibility and clarity of the lecturer; the importance of the lecturer believing in what they are saying; the importance of engaging with the audience; effective use of blackboards, notes, diagrams, examples and models; and the use of humour. Thomson's humour is clear throughout.

Thomson begins by emphasising the vital role that school education plays in civilised society. He takes the title of his talk from the H G Wells novel, to which he makes reference.

In the first letter, dated 28 Oct 1939 and numbered 12 (39), Thomson refers to Ledermann's manuscript, which he had originally enclosed with some deletions suggested by a referee. These have not survived in the collection. He tells Ledermann that he is unsure if Professor Kendall will apply for a Carnegie Grant, or if Thomson or Ledermann will have to. In the second letter, dated 15 Nov 1939 and numbered 12 a (39), Thomson invites Ledermann to tea and refers him again to the articles by E B Wilson and Jane Worcester, in particular two matrices of loadings which they use and which Thomson transcribes. He informs Ledermann that his son, Hector Thomson, will be continuing with his work in Nicosia.

This manuscript document is The dying advice of a great man, Duncan Forbes of Culloden esq., late Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland. The document is neither placed nor dated, but circa 1750. It purports to be the last words of the judge and politician Duncan Forbes (1685-1747), who rose to be Lord President of the Court of Session and a leading figure in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion. The religious advice in this manuscript is directed to his son. Although this is almost certainly a copy of the original document, it is a curious fact that the writing gets increasingly scrawled towards the end, almost as though the writer were actually approaching the end. The document is folio, 4-pages, and approximately 1300 words.

This roof-top pavilion was constructed in 1850 to the design of Marie Therese Short to house her Victorian optical instrument, and was originally called "Short's Observatory". Geddes bought the whole building in 1892 and changed the name to "The Outlook Tower". The "Biological Room" appears to have been formed by covering the roof-top terrace with a temporary cover to protect the plants, of which some are shown here.

The lecture was delivered to a wide audience, and is designed to be understood by non-statisticians, and non-educators. In it, Thomson explores the uses and limitations of statistics in both education and psychology, illustrating his points with examples of how an educator might effectively predict a child's performance and offer vocational guidance appropriate to their ability and intelligence.  Thomson discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample and the effect sampling bias has on investigations of causation, and highlights some of the difficulties in obtaining a sample and how these might be overcome. He also touches upon the use of statistics to inform the raising of the school age, and explores the use of statistical methods in collating examination marks to provide indicators of intelligence and predictors of future career success. He highlights the value in using statistical techniques, particularly the concept of distribution, to enhance teachers' ratings of pupils' ability and to enable direct comparison across age groups. He describes intelligence tests as a less subjective indication of future career and performance, while also discussing the phenomenon that an individual's test results in all tests, whether intelligence, dexterity, or vocational fitness, tend to be positively correlated.

Thomson argues that the British education system needs to make provision for vocational training, citing, in some detail, Germany's extensive system of vocational training as an example.

In his letter, dated 3 Mar 1938 and numbered 13 (38), Thomson thanks Ledermann for his previous letter, and responds to his points regarding the reciprocity of persons and tests, referring to Burt's statement that we can always deduce all we want to know about person-factors from an analysis into test-factors, or vice versa, and need only perform whichever analysis is convenient.

Thomson parallels and compares competition in the natural world, where the weakest are eliminated and education through play prepares the individual for their environment, with that in the human world, where co-operation protects the unfit and education contributes to a differential birth rate.  He discusses possible reasons for the connection between intelligence, education, and family size, exploring whether this phenomenon is due to genetics, environment, or both. He refers to intelligence testing he has conducted throughout several counties in England, including that of an English mining community and a concurrent test on Fatherless children; and testing carried out by the Mental Defective Committee establishing an increase in the incidence of mental defect.  Thomson outlines the ethical implications of such findings, and how imperative it is that all individuals be offered the best free education they can use. He argues that education is a crucial part of the solution to the differential birth rate.

In this lecture, Thomson explores what intelligence is. He discusses the tendency to see intelligence and instinct as separate entities, and why he thinks this is inaccurate; the idea that thinking is simply trial and error using concepts and imagery rather than action; and the correlation between consciousness and intelligence in relation to the flashes of insight that come from the unconscious. He also discusses the work of Spearman, suggesting that Spearman's two factor theory does not adequately represent the complexity of intelligence.

In the first letter, dated 15 Jan 1938 and numbered 8a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that his [Thomson's] manuscript regarding univariate selection has been sent back to him by F C Bartlett, as the publisher requires it typed, and advises him that his own manuscript has likely been sent back for the same reason.  In the second letter, dated 17 Jan 1938 and numbered 8b (38), Thomson asks Ledermann to check the Psychometric offprints for any misprints. He refers to work by Dodd he had originally enclosed on loan from J Neyman. This has not survived in the collection. In the third letter, dated 12 Feb 1938 and numbered 8 (38), Thomson continues from 7 (38) (Coll-1064/40). He reproduces matrices of raw marks, and refers to partial correlations between the tests for constant average marks for each child. He provides several pages of examples and working.

The lecture explores how schools could, and should, benefit the whole community by giving pupils a happy, clean environment which serves as a model for what the home should be, and by giving them the knowledge and skills in order to work towards solving practical and social problems in their communities.  He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.

Thomson discusses the importance of discipline in class both in a general sense, and specifically relating to music classes. He discusses the pitfalls of both too lenient and too harsh discipline; the importance of forming rules and ensuring these are as clear and as few as possible; the participation of pupils in rule making and reporting when rules are broken; and assigning a fitting punishment. He also gives pointers for achieving discipline, and stresses the responsibilities the teacher must undertake, including keeping proper records of students' progress and attendance, paying attention to the class, learning their names and being observant; and ensuring students' work is properly marked and good work rewarded.

The letter was written by Hugh MacDiarmid on 30 August 1958 from 'Brownsbank', Candymill, Biggar, Lanarkshire. It is addressed to Dr. Ringsleben - Mary Ringsleben having been awarded her Ph.D. two years earlier in 1956 (Aberdeen). MacDiarmid apologises for having 'retained your thesis so long'. He refers to having seen Dr. David Murison (deputy editor of the Scottish National Dictionary) in Edinburgh and that he had 'just missed you'. He describes the Ringsleben thesis as 'an excellent one and certainly the best thing written on Douglas by far'. He goes on to say that he is 'not going to make any little critical observations' apart from 'wishing to see it expanded and published'. Because it is 'on the short side for a book', he hopes she 'may decide to expand it'. MacDiarmid agrees 'in toto with all the main substance' of the study, and hopes that other subjects in Scots literature may attract her attention.

The address discusses the apparent schism between scholarship, culture, and vocation, with Thomson making the case that a good education needs to contain aspects of all three in order to produce a whole individual. He illustrates his points with examples of education from around the world.  In relation to this, Thomson discusses the project method, which involves students working together using individual skills, the folkhighschool movement in Denmark, the youth movement in Germany, and the auditorium work present in American high schools.  Thomson argues that everyone is entitled to an education whatever their ability. He stresses that schools do, and should, contain a mixture of students who have access to the same facilities, but whose individual abilities, as well as their interests, are catered to by educators.

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

In the first letter, dated 13 Mar 1928 and numbered 17 (38), Thomson discusses the work of M S Bartlett, in particular that the assumptions he makes about each person's ability in the unknown quality e will average zero over a number of persons. He refers to specification equations, and his trouble with them, in particular that they are true for all persons, using Robinson Crusoe as an analogy to show the problems with this premise. Ledermann has made brief marginal notes highlighting passages he agrees or disagrees with. In the second letter, dated 20 Mar 1938 and numbered 17a (38), Thomson states that he was dissatisfied with his previous letter, but having had no time to attend to it he has enclosed it and sent it as it is. He informs Ledermann that he will meet him in London, and encourages Ledermann to stay in London for as long as he wants. He refers briefly to Ledermann's correspondence with Paul Horst, as well as Thurstone's iterative process for finding commonalities.

The lecture explains factorial analysis in non-mathematical terms as far as possible, and Thomson explores how psychologists and mathematicians can work together and co-operate in order to gain knowledge of intelligence differences. Thomson references the work of Spearman, Hotelling, and Thurstone. Also includes a follow on lecture with 2 slides titled Positive Structure in Factorial Analysis, and three accompanying images. Thomson has attributed this to Walter Ledermann.

The notes taken down into this small bound pocket note-book of 131 handwritten pages are believed to have formed part of the Guy's lecture series - 'Elements in the Practice of Physic'. One of the early pages bears the inscription 'John Bethell, Lincoln's Inn Field' but it isn't clear if this was the same individual who took the notes or someone who subsequently owned them. The volume may be particularly important in that the contents significantly pre-date - when compared - the first edition of the published version of Saunders' lectures in 1780. Based upon differing formulations for remedies included in the notes and changes in topics covered, it is believed that the notes may have been taken down circa 1775 or possibly earlier. They are believed to pre-date the manuscript lecture notes held at the Wellcome Library (1780-1782) and the Heritage Library of the Royal College of Physicians (1782). Other Saunders' lecture notes at the Royal College of Surgeons were taken down in 1784, and those at the Royal Society of Medicine dating from 1795. Section headings and formulations for remedies contained in 'Elements in the Practice of Physic' include: Of the Inflammatory Fever; Of the Nervous Fever; Of Intermittent Fevers; Of the Malignant Angina; Of the Inflammation of the Intestines; Of the Rheumatism; Of the Measles; Of the Dropsy; Of Indigestion; Of the Epilepsy; Of the Tetanus; Of Insanity; Of Women During the Time They Are With Child and After Delivery; and, Diseases of Young Children.

Thomson begins by introducing the concept of individual differences in general terms, before moving on to his own topic of intelligence, and discussing the extent of individual intelligence differences. He illustrates the wideness of the intellectual range within the population by reproducing Cyril Burt's table, Distribution of Intelligence among Children and Adults, which contains suggested IQ scores for different levels of schooling and occupational complexity in England. Thomson gives examples of individuals at the extreme ends of intelligence, referring to precocious children, and to a report by the Mental Deficiency Committee on the prevalence of feeble-mindedness in the general population. He argues that this range is both inevitable and vital for society's progress.  Thomson then talks about the measurement of intelligence and stresses that we cannot fully differentiate human intelligence differences into classes, because in reality no such distinctions exist. Instead, intelligence tests identify an individual's position on a continuum.  Thomson ends with a discussion of the idea of selection, emphasising that it is often wrongly thought of as a process of exclusion, when in fact it should regarded and used as part of the process in establishing the correct path for the student, taking into account both their abilities and their interests. In this process, the educators have a social and professional responsibility to guide them in establishing the correct path for them as individuals. He argues that selection should be based not on a single test but following consideration of the pupils' performance throughout their primary school career.

The collection is composed of an imposing photograph of John A. W. Dollar, circa 1904-1905, in his presidential robes - President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons - and a bill with engraved bill-head of the Dollar veterinary practice on New Bond Street, London, with a fine engraved bill-head, a rare survival. The portrait was taken by the firm Elliott and Fry, 55 Baker Street, London W, and is numbered in pencil as No.206440D. The bill with engraved bill-head is dated in ink, 1901. It is the account between January 1901 and December 1901 with J. E. Taylor esq., Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and includes interesting information about veterinary costs in the early months of the 20th century - e.g. a 'nailing' presumably for a horse-shoe costing one shilling (January 16), four shoes for six shillings (April 1), and attendance, advice and a bottle of lotion for eight shillings and sixpence (June 13).

Thomson stresses the need for more investment and energy to be put into vocational education, looking to America as an example.  He emphasises the imbalance of educational investment between the average student versus the above average or the mentally impaired student, arguing that all 3 should receive the same investment, though the methods and curriculum may be different. He proposes the creation of secondary schools equipped for vocational training and apprenticeship, staffed by individuals trained in a trade, but also as teachers, to replace the current evening or day release classes. He gives examples from Germany and Britain of close liaison and co-operation between industry and educators, and cites the Air Training Corps and scheme of National Certificates as existing British foundations to build upon. Thomson argues that whatever education a student receives, it should be grounded in reality and their interests, and thus prepare them for work. He emphasises the need for career guidance for students and good methods of selection into trades, pleading the case that students' abilities and talents be considered throughout their school career rather than from a single test. He also stresses the need for information and individual tests to be made freely available in a centralised place to better facilitate students going into professions and vocations suited to their abilities and interests.

The photographs consist mainly of photographs of Alan Greenwood, staff from the Institute of Animal Genetics and Poultry Research Centre, their relations and visitors, and various events and conferences. There are also a number of photographs showing the construction and opening of the Poultry Research Centre building at Kings Buildings and the sub-station at Easter Bush. There appears to be a combination of official photographs taken, for instance, for a publication, and more informal snapshots. The photographs are mounted on sheets of foolscap paper which have been hole-punched and have presumably been removed from a folder at an earlier stage. The subjects of the pictures are often annotated, probably by Alan Greenwood.  Some sheets have photographs mounted on both sides, while other sheets have clearly had photographs removed. Except where noted, the photographs are in black and white. Many of the photographs are signed 'M.L', which denotes Miron Latyszewski, at that time a research officer at the Institute of Animal Genetics.

The manuscript intelligence report penned 23 October 1559 at 'Jedert', Jedburgh, contains news of movements of the forces loyal to the Protestant Lords of Congregation in Edinburgh and mentions skirmishes between them and the French garrison at Leith. Sent by Thomas Henderson, burgess of Jedburgh, to Sir John Forster, the letter updates Forster on developments in the hostilities between the Protestant Congregation and the Catholic side headed by the Scottish regent Mary of Guise (1515-1560). Henderson records the arrival of the Congregation in Edinburgh with a 'greit company' of horsemen and footmen, and 'greit artaill[er]ye' as well as Lords who were arriving - including Archibald Campbell 5th Earl of Argyll, and George Gordon 4th earl of Huntly. He then mentions news of a further 'xv thowsand' to come, noting that Mary, retired to fortified Leith, could muster 'scars iii thowsand men of weir of french and scotts'. The item is ink on paper in secretary hand. Folio (20 x 30 cm). One and a half pages penned on a bifolium.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed to James Nairne, on the death of Lord Eldin, placed and dated as Kensington, London, 12 June 1832. The letter refers to 'The Edinburgh Society of the Sons of the Clergy' and how they 'have done me [mu]ch honor'. Also, at a meeting in London, James Nairne's health was drunk, and his brother 'Capt Nairne' made 'an appropriate reply'. Nairne's announcement of the death of 'our antient friend Lord Eldin' recalls for David Wilkie 'a volume of thoughts. He was the last of his kind, having neither likelihood, nor resemblance to any thing that survives him'. Wilkie goes on to refer to Eldin's 'probable state of affairs' and how this may 'lead to the dispersion, of his pictures' and whether it would 'be wise to send them to London'.

In the first letter, dated 12 Apr 1938 and numbered 21 (38), Thomson tells Ledermann about his trip to Dumfries and the Galloway coast, informing him of his travel plans for the next few weeks which include going to Munich and Vienna. He asks Ledermann to undertake editing work on The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, in particular ensuring a second manuscript is up to date. Thomson also refers to the mathematical appendix he has completed and is sending on to Ledermann to ensure it is correct, and sends good wishes for Ledermann's tour. In the second letter, dated 19 Apr 1938 and numbered 21a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that he has sent the typed manuscripts of the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability to Moray House for him to pick up, and is currently getting the last chapter typed. He also refers to an unnamed cousin of Ledermann who is in some difficulty, and gives Ledermann the name of Sir Philip Hartog, who may be able to help him. Also includes a postcard, dated 21 May 1938 and numbered 21b (38), in which Thomson tells Ledermann briefly about his travels in Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and the professors he met there, and lets him know when he will be in Glenapp.

A villa in The Grange. The railings shown here have been replaced by a stone wall. Although the landed proprietor, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, commissioned the drawing-up of a fueing plan in 1825, the building of the villas did not begin until Grange Road was opened (as far as the cemetery) in 1845.
|
Thomson discusses how intelligence is distributed between the various social or occupational levels of society. He explains the normal distribution of intelligence within the population, drawing parallels with the distribution of height.  Thomson refers to inquiries carried out by him in Northumberland in 1922, and inquiries carried out in the Isle of Wight in 1924, which demonstrated that individual differences outweigh social differences, and supported the notion that heredity plays more part than environment in determining intelligence. He addresses the problem of the differential birth rate, arguing that the best defence against this is mankind's differences, and these should be encouraged by equality in education, allowing secondary schools to be a mixture of abilities and talents opposed to segregation of intelligence.

Thomson outlines the structure of the course and describes what is expected of the students, the value of practical experience, and the difficulties of offering practical experience alongside teaching on a training course. He also discusses the problem of practical experience impinging on written work and study, and how students can manage their time accordingly. Thomson describes the importance of ensuring the knowledge the students have of various classes is brought together, and how important it is that they should not be studied in isolation. He emphasises the importance of understanding key tenets of sociology in relation to education, coming to the course with an open mind, and learning from each other. He also includes a quotation from James Maxwell outlining the function of the Training College in ensuring a synthesis of the students' knowledge takes place.

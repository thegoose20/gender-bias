Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

The second edition of Holinshed's history of Britain was the edition used by William Shakespeare as the principal source for his histories and also for Macbeth.  The printing history of this work is of particular interest. In February 1587, the printers were ordered by the Privy Council and the Archbishop of Canterbury to delete nine passages that contained objectionable accounts of recent history - three in volume II (Scotland), six in volume III (England). The Privy Council censored text, but of course the printers had to cancel whole leaves, 82 leaves in all. Most surviving copies of the work were duly 'castrated' to order, and cancels (only twelve of them) were inserted to bridge the gaps. In the eighteenth century the original text was reprinted three times from an 'uncastrated' copy or copies, and after 1722 or 1723 these reprinted leaves were generally used to complete later-bound collectors' sets in facsimile. As an interesting aside, some original leaves could escape the Privy Council knife, as in one instance in this Edinburgh University Library copy, where in volume III, there are untouched leaves relating to a report of English support for the Duke of Alen√ßon's departure in 1582 to assume sovereignty of Zeeland. This was an unhappy episode which was to mark a failure in Elizabeth's policy in the Low Countries. The cancel is said to reduce the report from 362 lines to 12. This Edinburgh copy also includes 4 of the original 1587 cancel leaves inserted loose alongside their 18th century facsimile replacements (representing, in volume II, pp. 421, 424, 438, 431, 443, 444, 445 and 450).

Thomas Campbell was born on 27 July 1777 in Glasgow where he went to school showing promise as a poet and an interest in Classics. He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Charlotte Auerbach arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1933 after being forced to flee Germany and the anti-Semitic laws in place there at the time. Auerbach became best known for her 1941 discovery with J.M. Robson that mustard gas causes mutagenesis. This material was likely gathered together as part of Beale's preparation of his biographical memoir of Auerbach which was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).

The English composer, music journalist and pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji on 14 August 1892 in Chingford, Essex. He was the son of a Parsi father and a Spanish-Sicilian mother. As a composer Sorabji was self-taught. As a critic Sorabji was connected to the radical weekly New Age magazine which had been taken over by Alfred Richard Orage, and to New English Weekly. His music criticism was notable for its acerbity and wit, and also for championing - at the time - unfashionable composers such as Mahler and Szymanowski. His own works were of great complexity, and he played them in London and Paris in 1921 and in Vienna in 1922. Thereafter he discouraged public performance of his music until relenting in the mid-1970s. He remained something of a cult figure however. His works included the Symphonic High Mass (1955-1961), the massive (four-hour), multi-movement Opus clavicembalisticum (1930), and the Etudes transcendantes (1940-1944).  Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji died at Winfrith Newburgh, near Dorchester, in Dorset on 15 October 1988. He had been a friend of the composer Alistair Hinton, who was the founder of the Sorabji Archive. In 1994 many of his original manuscripts went to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle, Switzerland.

In 1931 she married the American theologian Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971). They made New York City their home. During the 1930s she was a lay minister preaching in Anglican churches and in this capacity she raised questions about the the role of women in the church. From 1940, and first as a lecturer, she was a member of the Barnard College faculty for some 20 years. She retired in the 1960s and died on 10 January 1997. John Baillie was born in 1886. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force, then an academic career followed. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retiral six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, becoming a President of the latter. He died in 1960.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

Sarah Boreland of Dumfries had been instructed 'in the knowledge of the Practice of Midwifery' by Professor James Hamilton and had attended the Edinburgh General Lying-in Hospital. Hamilton considered 'her to be properly qualified for the important duty of midwife'. Boreland may have continued her career later on in Australia. The qualifying certificate issued to Boreland by Professor Hamilton had been discovered in New South Wales. James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senate as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830.  Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or peurperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837). Professor James Hamilton died in November 1839.

Beale first joined the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), in 1935 as a volunteer assistant, after graduating from Imperial College, London. He was shortly offered paid employment by J.B.S. Haldane, who was then part-time head of the genetics group until 1941. Beale later claimed that 'the appointment at John Innes was a marvellous step forward as the Institution was at that time the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain, rivalled only by Crew's Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh.' Beale's studies encompassed Neurospora and Verbena before he was called up for military service in January 1941.

William Hunter was born on 1 June 1861 in Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast. He was educated at Ayr Academy, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1883 with M.B., C.M. (1st Class) 1883, and M.D. (Gold Medal) 1886. He served as a house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and as a Physican to the Western Dispensary, Edinburgh. He had also studied overseas at Leipzig in 1884 with a grant from the BMA, and during the period 1887-1890 he visited Vienna and Strasbourg. Also during 1887-1890 he worked full time on laboratory research at Cambridge, devoting himself to pernicious anaemia. From 1895, Hunter was affiliated with the Charing Cross Hospital and the London Fever Hospital. Earlier, in 1894, he married Beatrice Fielden, daughter of Joshua Fielden MP. He was the first person to note that the alimentary and the nervous system were often affected in pernicious anaemia, and he regarded the haemolytic element as being most important and made numerous observations on the excessive pigmentation and iron deposition in the liver. Hunter, along with Julius Otto Ludwig Moeller, is associated with 'Hunter's glossitis' caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency ('Moeller-Hunter glossitis'), and he is also associated with the 'Serbian barrel' used for disinfection and the eradication of lice during the First World War in Serbia. During the First World War, Hunter served in Serbia with the British Military Sanitary Mission where he developed de-lousing techniques to control typhus. He was appointed as a Grand Officer of the Serbian Order of St. Sava in June 1915. In December 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches and was awarded the Companion Order of the Bath (CB). He was President of the Advisory Committee, Prevention of Disease, in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia (Gallipoli, Egypt, Salonika, Malta and Palestine), and he served with the Eastern Command, 1917-1919, as Consulting Physician. He held the rank of Colonel. Hunter's published work includesOral sepsis as a cause of 'Septic gastritis', 'Toxic neuritis' and other septic conditions(1901),Pernicious anaemia: its pathology, septic origin, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Based upon original investigations(1901),A research into epidemic and epizootic plague(1904),Severest anaemias. Their infective nature, diagnosis and treatment(1909),Historical account of Charing Cross hospital and medical school (University of London): original plan and statutes, rise and progress(1914), andThe Serbian epidemics of typhus and relapsing fever in 1915(1920). He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP London 1896) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and he was awarded an Honorary LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1927. William Hunter died on 13 January 1937.

Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In 1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890

Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.

The Scottish poet Sorley MacLean was born in Oscaig, Raasay, on 26 October 1911. He was educated locally and then at Portree High School. He studied English Literature at Edinburgh University from 1929, graduating in 1933 with a First. MacLean then began a teaching career, starting in Portree after qualifying from Moray House (teacher training college). Briefly between 1937-1938 he taught at Tobermoray Secondary School before returning to Edinburgh in 1939 to the English Department of Boroughmuir High School. In 1940, MacLean joined the Signals Corps and was posted to North Africa. He was seriously wounded at El Alamein in November 1942, and was invalided home to Scotland. He returned to his teaching post at Boroughmuir in 1943. In 1946 he married Renee Cameron. Although their life seemed settled in Edinburgh, and Sorley had been drawn into the literary circle of Douglas Young and his associates, which included George Campbell Hay, Norman McCaig, and especially Robert Garioch (Alastair Sutherland), he accepted the appointment of Headmaster at Plockton High School in 1956. MacLean's output included Seventeen Poems for Six-pence (with Garioch, 1940), Dain do Eimhir (1943), and co-authorship of Four Points of a Saltire (1970). He retired as Headmaster at Plockton in 1972 but then found himself drawn into a new educational experience, first as the Creative Writing Fellow at Edinburgh University (1973-5) and then as Filidh ('Poet') at the then embryonic Gaelic College at Sabhal Mor Ostaig (1975-6). Sorley MacLean died in Inverness on 24 November 1996.

Rev Thomas Allan was born on 16 August 1916 in Newmilnes, Ayrshire to William and Agnes. He was educated at Newmilnes Primary School and Kilmarnock Academy before going on to graduate from the University of Glasgow with a first class honours degree in English Literature. In 1945, following a number of years war service in the RAF he entered Trinity Theological College, Glasgow and was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1946.
In 1941 Tom Allan married Jane Moore and they had three children, Margaret Elizabeth, William Thomas and Kenneth John.
Rev Tom Allan's first charge was North Kelvinside Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1953 when he left to join the "Tell Scotland" movement. Tell Scotland started as a result of two Scottish radio missions of the BBC in which leading preachers of several denominations combined in a nation wide evangelistic drive. In 1953 the "Tell Scotland" committee was formed and Rev Tom Allan was appointed evangelistic organiser. He became a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century and travelled extensively throughout Britain in his capacity as evangelist for the Church of Scotland. In 1955 when Billy Graham held his 'All Scotland Crusade', Tom Allan was Chairman of the organizing committee.
In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

George Chalmers was born in Fochabers, in Moray, in 1742, and was educated in Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He studied Law at Edinburgh University. At the age of twenty-one he travelled with his uncle to America, to Maryland, and he practised law in Baltimore. On the outbreak of the American Civil War he returned to Britain, settling in London in 1775 where he began writing chiefly on political and colonial matters. In 1786 he was appointed to the Board of Trade as 'chief clerk of the committee of privy council for trade and foreign plantations'. He then turned to writing biography, publishing on Daniel Defoe, Thomas Paine and Thomas Ruddiman (Scottish grammarian and printer). In the 1800s he turned to the poetry and history of Scotland publishing poems of Allan Ramsay and Sir David Lyndsay. His works included: Annals of the present United Colonies (1780), Three tracts on Ireland (1785), Life of Daniel De Foe (1786), The poems of Allan Ramsay, with a Life of the author (1800), Caledonia starting in 1807, and Life of Mary Queen of Scots, drawn from the State Papers, with six subsidiary memoirs (1818).

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project ‚Äì not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a ¬£5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

In 1903 Dr. Arthur Logan Turner (1865-1939) became an Assistant Surgeon at the Ear and Throat Department at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. By 1906, he was a Surgeon, and then in 1921, a Surgeon-Consultant. In 1924, he became Consultant Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary and at Deaconess Hospital in Edinburgh. He was also a Lecturer in Diseases of the Larynx, Ear and Nose at Edinburgh University from 1906 to 1924. It was during this period in Turner's career that the lecture notes in this collection were written by an unknown student.

The Scottish Widows Fund and Equitable Assurance Society, or Scottish Widows, was established in 1815 in Edinburgh. The idea for the setting up of a fund for the financial protection of the relatives of deceased clergyman and schoolmasters had been put forward by a group of prominent Scotsmen in March 1812. The fund would protect 'widows, sisters and other females' from poverty, and would be achieved by insuring capital sums on lives. The plan was extend the benefits of the fund to all parts of Britain. By September 1821, funds had reached ¬£20,000, and in 1845 they stood at ¬£1,700,000. In our own modern times Scottish Widows became part of Lloyds TSB Group.

Cunningham was born at Crieff, Perth, and educated at the Morrison's Academy, Crieff, and Edinburgh University graduating M.B. in 1874. He was Demonstrator in Anatomy at Edinburgh, 1876-1882, and Professor of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, 1882, at Dublin University, 1883-1903, and at Edinburgh University, 1903-1909. He carried out original research in human and comparative anatomy as well as in the wider field of anthropology including giantism and right-handedness and left-brainedness. He undertook a number of important public duties including service in 1900 with the Royal Commission on the Care of the Sick and the Wounded during the South African War. He was elected FRS in 1891.

John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.

Poet, essayist, literary critic, historian, and social commentator, Christopher Murray Grieve, also known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was born on 11 August 1892 in Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt. They were married in 1914 just after he had been appointed headmaster of the Burgh (now known as the Grammar) School in Kirkwall. During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. His published works include The Orkney Norn (1929), and posthumously Orkney Farm-Names (1952).  Dr Hugh Marwick died in Kirkwall on 21 May 1965.

Janet S.S Blyth studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1918-1921, gaining a BSc in Agricultural Sciences in 1921. In the same year, she became a research student in the Department of Animal Breeding, graduating PhD in 1925. In 1926 she began work as assistant to Alan Greenwood in the section of Research on the Sex Physiology of the Fowl, moving across with him to the Poultry Research Centre after 1947.

In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.

Norman Kemp Smith was born in Dundee in 1872. He was educated at Dundee High School and at Harris Academy, Dundee. He studied at the University of St. Andrews and afterward at Jena, Zurich, Berlin, and Paris. He was a Lecturer in Philosophy at Glasgow University from 1897 to 1906 when he went to Princeton, New Jersey, as Professor of Psychology and then, from 1914, as Professor of Philosophy. Between 1916 and 1918, during the First World War, he served with the Department of Information in London. From 1919, Kemp held the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh and occupied the post until his retirement in 1945. He had also taken his share of University administration in varied officies such as Assessor on the University Court and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts. His major published works included output on three 17th and 18th century philosophers, Descartes, Hume, and Kant,Commentary on Kant's critique of pure reason(1918), a translation of Kant'sCritique of pure reason(1929),The philosophy of David Hume(1941), andNew studies in the philosophy of Descartes(1951). Professor Norman Kemp Smith died in Edinburgh on 3 September 1958.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

Charles Arthur Anderson studied at Edinburgh University and graduated with the degree of MB CM in 1889. He was registered as a surgeon on 2 August 1889, and in the Medical register for 1889 he is noted as being located at Hillswick, Shetland Islands. His subsequent career saw him in Burnley, Lancashire, from 1900 until around 1927-1928 when he was located in Bridge of Allan, Central Scotland. His name fell from the Medical register after the 1934 edition.

Thomas Young was probably born in 1725. By the summer of 1751, Young was practicing surgery in Edinburgh. In 1756 he was appointed Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University - only the third holder of that Chair, after Robert Smith and Joseph Gibson, the first holder. Young was the first Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh to actually lecture on the subject of obstetrics. He also had an association with Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary. Professor Thomas Young died 5 February 1783 at the age fifty-seven.

The Scottish poet, author and dramatist, George Mackay Brown, was born on 17 October 1921. His work has a distinctly Orcadian character and he is considered one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century. Brown had a long association with publishers Chatto and Windus. This had begun in 1959 when they published, under its Hogarth Press imprint, his second volume of poetry Loaves and Fishes. He remained with Chatto and Windus until 1984. It had been Hugo Brunner (Chatto and Windus) who first suggested that someone should write the story of his life, and the writer proposed was Maggie Fergusson. The job was done with Fergusson's The Life of George Mackay Brown published in 2006 by John Murray. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996. Hugo Brunner (Sir Hugo Lawrence Joseph Brunner) was born on 17 August 1935. His parents were Sir Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897-1982) and Dorothea Elizabeth, daughter of the Victorian era actor manager Henry Irving (1838-1905). Hugo Brunner was educated at Eton and he studied at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated with the degree of MA (Hons). Between 1958 and 1965, Brunner was with Oxford University Press and was OUP representative in Hong Kong, 1960-1962. From 1966 until 1976 he was Sales Director with Chatto and Windus, publishers. He returned to OUP in 1977 and was then back again at Chatto and Windus in 1979 as Managing Director, then Chairman, until 1985. Brunner has also been Director of Caithness Glass Ltd., 1966-1996, and Chairman 1984-1991. He has seen involvement with Brunner Investment Trust Plc., 1987-1999, and with SCM Press Ltd., 1991-1997.  On 7 January 1967, Brunner married Mary Rose Catherine Pollen, daughter of Arthur Joseph Lawrence Pollen and Hon. Daphne Baring, and grand-daughter of Cecil Baring, 3rd Baron Revelstoke of Membland. Hugo Brunner contested the constituency of Torquay for the Liberals in 1964 and 1966. He was Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, England, between 1996 and 2008, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

Alan Owen was born in Inverness on 2 September 1922. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy. At the time of starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1939, his family still lived in Inverness. At University he followed classes in English and British History between 1939 and 1940, English and Philosophy from 1940 to 1941, then Latin, Psychology and Geography from 1941 to 1942. War service presumably followed because he did not graduate with the degree of MA until June 1946. Thereafter he was awarded the diploma and degree of Dip.Ed. (1947) and B.Ed. (1948). Anne Hyslop Gemmell was born in Coalburn, Lanarkshire, on 16 June 1923. She was educated at Ormiston Public School and at schools in Wishaw and Cumnock. At the time of her starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1941, her family still lived in Ormiston. At University she followed classes in French, German and Political Economy between 1941 and 1942, French and German during 1942 and 1943, then Psychology, Moral Philosophy and Economic History between 1945 and 1946. She graduated in January 1945, and was awarded a Diploma in Social Study in 1947. Both Alan Owen and Anne Hyslop Gemmell were members and associates of the XIIth International Congress of Pyschology held in Edinburgh at the University of Edinburgh between 23 July and 29 July 1948.

John Archibald Watt Dollar, born in 1866, was a member of the equine veterinary practice T. A. Dollar and Sons, Veterinary Surgeons, New Bond Street, London. His father, the founder of the practice, was Thomas Aitken Dollar (1833-1909). The elder Dollar studied at the then Edinburgh Veterinary College and was awarded the Highland and Agricultural Society's certificate in 1851. In 1880, he was Vice-President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. By the time Dollar died on 26 September 1909, the veterinary practice was the largest in London with a presence (veterinary forges) in Baker Street, in Westminster, in Blackfriars, in Lambeth, in Belgrave Square, in Chelsea, and in Paddington. The practice also had paddocks at Wells House Farm, East Acton During the 1880s, John Archibald Watt Dollar and his older brother William Watt Dollar (1860-1938) joined their father's veterinary business, though the younger Dollar spent much of his time travelling abroad and visiting veterinary colleges. John was credited with introducing the first equine operating table to Britain - the table had been designed by himself. He published too and his works include: a translation ofMoeller's operative veterinary surgery(1894), then with Albert Wheatley and othersA handbook of horse-shoeing with introductory chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot(1898), then with Gustave Moussu,Diseases of cattle, sheep, goats and swine(1905), and with Heinrich Moeller, theRegional Veterinary Surgery and Operative Technique (incorporating Prof. Dr. H. Moeller's 'Veterinary Surgery'.)(1912), andDollar's Veterinary surgery : general, operative, and regionalwhich went to a 4th edition in 1950. John A. W. Dollar was Warden of the Worshipful Company of Farriers from 1900 to 1903, and was President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, circa 1904-1905. On the death of their father in 1909, the two brothers continued to work together at the practice which moved to Baker Street in 1919. They retired in 1926 however, and the practice was sold to a Mr. Tay. John Archibald Watt Dollar died in 1947.

George Baillie was born on 16 March 1664. He was the son of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood and, through his mother Rachel, grandson of Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston, Edinburgh, Lord Warriston in the Cromwellian Parliament.Baillie's father was executed in 1684 on a charge of complicity in the Rye House plot, and after the execution the younger Baillie fled to Holland with his father's political associate, Sir Patrick Hume, who later became the 1st Earl of Marchmont. When William of Orange ascended the throne, Baillie returned to Scotland and played a prominent role as a leader of the Squadrone, whose votes gave the Act of Union a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Earlier, in September 1691 he married Grisell, the daughter of Sir Patrick Hume.He served in the Scottish Parliament as MP for Berwickshire, 1693-1698, and 1700-1701, and MP for Lanarkshire 1703-1707. Then in the British Parliament he served as a Lord Commissioner of Trade, 1710-1712, as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, 1714-1717, and as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, 1717-1725.Between May 1731 and October 1733, Baillie spent time in Italy with his wife. In 1734 he stood down from his Parliamentary career, and on 6 August 1738 he died.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest.

Benjamin Franklin, born in Boston on 17 January 1706, was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, musician, inventor, satirist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He facilitated many civic organizations, including a fire department and a university. He was one of the United States Ministers to France from 1778-1785, and to Sweden from 1782-1783. He had been Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1764, and was the 6th President of Pennsylvania between 1785 and 1788. He had also been the first US Postmaster General. Dr. Benjamin Franklin died in Philadelphia on 17 April 1790. Benjamin Rush was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was born in Philadelphia on 4 January 1746. Rush lived in the state of Pennsylvania and was a physician, writer, educator, humanitarian, as well as the founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He studied at Princeton and at Edinburgh University. Rush signed the Declaration of Independence and attended the Continental Congress. He served as Surgeon General in the Continental army, and was blamed for criticising George Washington. Later in life, Rush became a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Benjamin Rush died in Philadelphia on 19 April 1813. Jonathan Potts was born in Pennsylvania in 1745. He studied at Edinburgh University (its Medical School). He had also studied at the first school of medicine in America, the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1768. He had been in the first graduating class. Dr. Potts was given command of the Fort George General Hospital, the single largest hospital in North America at the time. His efforts returned hundreds of men to the Continental Army at a critical moment in American history. He made a major and substantial contribution to American victory on Lake Champlain in 1776. Dr. Jonathan Potts died in 1781.

William Baird possibly had an association with Dysart in Fife, Scotland, in the seventeenth century. Within the manuscript, in its first part, there are a number of clues that supply a date to his life and indicate the Scottish origin of the item. Under an explanation of the Dominical Letter system for discovering the day of the week corresponding to any date is included a mnemonic beginning, 'At Dysart dwells George Bronn Esquire'. The inclusion of this mnemonic suggests that Baird was engaged in teaching mathematics to others and that he was doing so in Scotland. In addition to the reference to Dysart, there is also mention of Scottish money - 'Lib Scotts' - and a date of 1676 is supplied in another calculation. Dysart is a small town on the River Forth, on the northern shore of its large estuary. Dating from the 13th century, the town established itself in the middle of the 15th century as a trading port, exporting salt and coal to the Low Countries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. It had been towards the end of the 16th century that the first coal pit in the town was sunk - known as Lady Blanche. By the middle of the 17th century when coal began to surpass the salt trade, two new pits followed - Frances and Randolph. Two hundred years later, in 2009, there was no coal trade and no salt trade, and the community was a suburb of Kirkcaldy.

David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics.

Andrew Nisbet Bogle was born on 28 June 1868 in Callander, in central Scotland. He was the son of the Rev. Andrew Bogle (d. 1900), Minister of Callander Free Church, and Catherine Nisbet Bogle. He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh, and he studied at Edinburgh University where he was awarded his degree of M.A. in 1890.

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until 1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina Struthers. His publications includeA Concise Dictionary of musical terms(1884),Chopin as a man and musician(1888), andProgramme music in the last four centuries(1907), and Struthers edited hisRobert Schumannfor posthumous publication in 1925. He retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

James Campbell was born at Carsphairn (Dumfries and Galloway), on 16 July 1789, to William Campbell (1755-1829) and his wife Agnes (nee Riggs) (1760-1838). He studied for the ministry at Glasgow University (matriculated 1806) and was licensed by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright on 7 May 1817. He spent time as tutor to the Hart family of Castlemilk, and travelled to France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with them (around 1814). He was with them during their flight from France when Napoleon returned to power. On his return to Scotland he searched for a suitable parish, and became tutor to the family of Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie in Traquair parish. He was ordained as Minister of Traquair (Church of St. Bride) in September 1820, having been presented by George, Prince Regent, in January 1820. Campbell spent his whole ministerial career in Traquair. On 26 October 1820 James Campbell married Mary Combe (d. 1860), daughter of Matthew Combe, a Leith brewer. One of their daughters, Agnes Mary Campbell, married Jardine Wallace (1834-1910) who succeeded James Campbell as Minister at Traquair. James Campbell died on 29 April 1861, aged 71.

Alexander Crum Brown was born on 26 March 1838. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Mill Hill School, and he studied at the Universities of Edinburgh, Heidleberg and Marburg. He was an extra-academical Lecturer in Chemistry at the University, 1863-1869. Professor Crum Brown, as he was known, was one of the greatest holders of the University of Edinburgh's Chair of Chemistry, from 1869. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although kindly and popular he struggled to keep control of some rather riotous classes. He retired in 1908. Crum Brown was President of the Chemical Society of London, 1893-1893. Professor Alexander Crum Brown died on 28 October 1922. George Burns obtained a B.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1896.

Thomas Cunningham Penfold was born on 14 October 1872 in Brampton, Cumberland. He was the son of John Blake Penfold, a painter, and Marianne Penfold (formerly Cunningham) and twin brother of Henry Penfold. Penfold studied at Edinburgh University, graduating M.B., C.M. in 1894. He then went on to study for his M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (London) and the D.T.H. (Dublin), and then set himself up in private medical practice at Benwell, Newcastle. He was joined by another brother, Dr. W. J. Penfold who later became Director of the Baker Institute, Melbourne, Australia. After several years in practice Penfold began to follow up an interest in public health work, and in 1910 he was appointed as Medical Officer to the Isolation Hospital, Prudhoe, and was also Medical Officer in Hexham. In 1914 he became Medical Officer of Health to the Bishop Auckland Rural District Council and in 1925 he moved to Chester-le-Street as Medical Officer of Health and Medical Officer of the Chester-le-Street Isolation Hospital. While in post he was involved in the moves towards slum clearance in the rural area of Chester-le-Street and he also campaigned for the creation of healthy schools and healthy homes for children so that infectious diseases could be reduced. Dr. Thomas Cunningham Penfold died suddenly in a Newcastle nursing home on 13 May 1935, leaving a widow and three daughters.

Henry Stewart Noel McFarland was born in Perth on 25 December 1924. He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946.  McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning.  Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK.  McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham. He passed away suddenly in 1973, aged 48.

Thomson outlines his ideals for educational research, which he feels is at its best when conducted by an individual investigating fundamental educational problems. He acknowledges that modern research is in reality constrained by input from collaborators or funders. Thomson discusses how research bodies such as the National Foundation and the Scottish Council for Research in Education can help the researcher in a variety of ways, including not limiting the researcher with too many or too exacting instructions, not demanding too quick a return, and involving the researcher in the design of experiments. He explores team work and co-operation, giving the Scottish Mental Surveys as an example, and emphasises the importance of strong, inspirational, and collaborative leadership. He also discusses the responsibilities of the researcher undertaking individual research, including the design of experiments and the utilising of research tools such as statistics; and the supposed dichotomy of fundamental and operational research. The lecture is written on the reverse side of headed paper from the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology. Edinburgh, 23rd July-29th July.

The letter refers to his objective of doing 'justice to the memory of' Richardson, and goes on to mention the 'essay on the causes of the decline of Foreign trade, which I think was written by Mr. Richardson'. In the letter he says that the essay 'is very generally attributed to Sir Matthew Decker'. He hopes though that he might be informed 'of some facts and circumstances which would enable' him to settle the 'doubtful point in favour' of the woman's brother. He asks if she knows of any papers remaining 'which prove that Mr. Richardson wrote this essay, or anything else'. Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679-1749) was an English merchant and writer on trade, an MP, and director of the East India Company.

The letter was written by Hugh MacDiarmid on 30 August 1958 from 'Brownsbank', Candymill, Biggar, Lanarkshire. It is addressed to Dr. Ringsleben - Mary Ringsleben having been awarded her Ph.D. two years earlier in 1956 (Aberdeen). MacDiarmid apologises for having 'retained your thesis so long'. He refers to having seen Dr. David Murison (deputy editor of the Scottish National Dictionary) in Edinburgh and that he had 'just missed you'. He describes the Ringsleben thesis as 'an excellent one and certainly the best thing written on Douglas by far'. He goes on to say that he is 'not going to make any little critical observations' apart from 'wishing to see it expanded and published'. Because it is 'on the short side for a book', he hopes she 'may decide to expand it'. MacDiarmid agrees 'in toto with all the main substance' of the study, and hopes that other subjects in Scots literature may attract her attention.

The lecture was delivered to a wide audience, and is designed to be understood by non-statisticians, and non-educators. In it, Thomson explores the uses and limitations of statistics in both education and psychology, illustrating his points with examples of how an educator might effectively predict a child's performance and offer vocational guidance appropriate to their ability and intelligence.  Thomson discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample and the effect sampling bias has on investigations of causation, and highlights some of the difficulties in obtaining a sample and how these might be overcome. He also touches upon the use of statistics to inform the raising of the school age, and explores the use of statistical methods in collating examination marks to provide indicators of intelligence and predictors of future career success. He highlights the value in using statistical techniques, particularly the concept of distribution, to enhance teachers' ratings of pupils' ability and to enable direct comparison across age groups. He describes intelligence tests as a less subjective indication of future career and performance, while also discussing the phenomenon that an individual's test results in all tests, whether intelligence, dexterity, or vocational fitness, tend to be positively correlated.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed from the X-ray pioneer to 'My dear Forbes' on their leaving the Royal High School, placed and dated as Edinburgh (Dalhousie Terrace), 13 March 1889. The letter was written when Spence was 17-years old. He writes, 'In parting with you I part from a friend, and I hope you will not take it as an insult when I say that I have a greater liking for you than I ever had for any of my companions'. He hopes Forbes reached home safely, and he is looking forward to seeing his own parents soon: 'They will leave Constantinople about the first week of April'. He has been up at the school 'paying the V a general visit'. Spence goes on to talk about the forthcoming 'Interscholastic Games at Corstorphine' to be held on 13 April 1889, and how 'Wilson is going in for the long drop at the Interscholastic' and how he 'was thinking of going in for the half mile handicap' at their own School Games to be held on the same day. Additionally, some local historical information is provided in that there is a reference to Jessie King who 'was executed in the Calton Jail on Monday morning. She took things very coolly to the very last', he writes.

The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

Compiled by Graeme D. Eddie, Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections.Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

The second edition of Holinshed's history of Britain was the edition used by William Shakespeare as the principal source for his histories and also for Macbeth.  The printing history of this work is of particular interest. In February 1587, the printers were ordered by the Privy Council and the Archbishop of Canterbury to delete nine passages that contained objectionable accounts of recent history - three in volume II (Scotland), six in volume III (England). The Privy Council censored text, but of course the printers had to cancel whole leaves, 82 leaves in all. Most surviving copies of the work were duly 'castrated' to order, and cancels (only twelve of them) were inserted to bridge the gaps. In the eighteenth century the original text was reprinted three times from an 'uncastrated' copy or copies, and after 1722 or 1723 these reprinted leaves were generally used to complete later-bound collectors' sets in facsimile. As an interesting aside, some original leaves could escape the Privy Council knife, as in one instance in this Edinburgh University Library copy, where in volume III, there are untouched leaves relating to a report of English support for the Duke of Alen√ßon's departure in 1582 to assume sovereignty of Zeeland. This was an unhappy episode which was to mark a failure in Elizabeth's policy in the Low Countries. The cancel is said to reduce the report from 362 lines to 12. This Edinburgh copy also includes 4 of the original 1587 cancel leaves inserted loose alongside their 18th century facsimile replacements (representing, in volume II, pp. 421, 424, 438, 431, 443, 444, 445 and 450).

He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Charlotte Auerbach arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1933 after being forced to flee Germany and the anti-Semitic laws in place there at the time. Auerbach became best known for her 1941 discovery with J.M. Robson that mustard gas causes mutagenesis. This material was likely gathered together as part of Beale's preparation of his biographical memoir of Auerbach which was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).

The English composer, music journalist and pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji on 14 August 1892 in Chingford, Essex. He was the son of a Parsi father and a Spanish-Sicilian mother. As a composer Sorabji was self-taught. As a critic Sorabji was connected to the radical weekly New Age magazine which had been taken over by Alfred Richard Orage, and to New English Weekly. His music criticism was notable for its acerbity and wit, and also for championing - at the time - unfashionable composers such as Mahler and Szymanowski. His own works were of great complexity, and he played them in London and Paris in 1921 and in Vienna in 1922. Thereafter he discouraged public performance of his music until relenting in the mid-1970s. He remained something of a cult figure however. His works included the Symphonic High Mass (1955-1961), the massive (four-hour), multi-movement Opus clavicembalisticum (1930), and the Etudes transcendantes (1940-1944).  Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji died at Winfrith Newburgh, near Dorchester, in Dorset on 15 October 1988. He had been a friend of the composer Alistair Hinton, who was the founder of the Sorabji Archive. In 1994 many of his original manuscripts went to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle, Switzerland.

Ursula Mary Keppel-Compton was born in Southampton, England, in 1907. She was a graduate of Oxford University, St. Hugh's College, and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York from which she graduated as Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.). In 1931 she married the American theologian Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971). They made New York City their home. During the 1930s she was a lay minister preaching in Anglican churches and in this capacity she raised questions about the the role of women in the church. From 1940, and first as a lecturer, she was a member of the Barnard College faculty for some 20 years. She retired in the 1960s and died on 10 January 1997. John Baillie was born in 1886. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force, then an academic career followed. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retiral six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, becoming a President of the latter. He died in 1960.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

Sarah Boreland of Dumfries had been instructed 'in the knowledge of the Practice of Midwifery' by Professor James Hamilton and had attended the Edinburgh General Lying-in Hospital. Hamilton considered 'her to be properly qualified for the important duty of midwife'. Boreland may have continued her career later on in Australia. The qualifying certificate issued to Boreland by Professor Hamilton had been discovered in New South Wales. James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senate as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830.  Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or peurperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837). Professor James Hamilton died in November 1839.

Beale first joined the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), in 1935 as a volunteer assistant, after graduating from Imperial College, London. He was shortly offered paid employment by J.B.S. Haldane, who was then part-time head of the genetics group until 1941. Beale later claimed that 'the appointment at John Innes was a marvellous step forward as the Institution was at that time the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain, rivalled only by Crew's Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh.' Beale's studies encompassed Neurospora and Verbena before he was called up for military service in January 1941.

William Hunter was born on 1 June 1861 in Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast. He was educated at Ayr Academy, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1883 with M.B., C.M. (1st Class) 1883, and M.D. (Gold Medal) 1886. He served as a house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and as a Physican to the Western Dispensary, Edinburgh. He had also studied overseas at Leipzig in 1884 with a grant from the BMA, and during the period 1887-1890 he visited Vienna and Strasbourg. Also during 1887-1890 he worked full time on laboratory research at Cambridge, devoting himself to pernicious anaemia. From 1895, Hunter was affiliated with the Charing Cross Hospital and the London Fever Hospital. Earlier, in 1894, he married Beatrice Fielden, daughter of Joshua Fielden MP. He was the first person to note that the alimentary and the nervous system were often affected in pernicious anaemia, and he regarded the haemolytic element as being most important and made numerous observations on the excessive pigmentation and iron deposition in the liver. Hunter, along with Julius Otto Ludwig Moeller, is associated with 'Hunter's glossitis' caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency ('Moeller-Hunter glossitis'), and he is also associated with the 'Serbian barrel' used for disinfection and the eradication of lice during the First World War in Serbia. During the First World War, Hunter served in Serbia with the British Military Sanitary Mission where he developed de-lousing techniques to control typhus. He was appointed as a Grand Officer of the Serbian Order of St. Sava in June 1915. In December 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches and was awarded the Companion Order of the Bath (CB). He was President of the Advisory Committee, Prevention of Disease, in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia (Gallipoli, Egypt, Salonika, Malta and Palestine), and he served with the Eastern Command, 1917-1919, as Consulting Physician. He held the rank of Colonel. Hunter's published work includesOral sepsis as a cause of 'Septic gastritis', 'Toxic neuritis' and other septic conditions(1901),Pernicious anaemia: its pathology, septic origin, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Based upon original investigations(1901),A research into epidemic and epizootic plague(1904),Severest anaemias. Their infective nature, diagnosis and treatment(1909),Historical account of Charing Cross hospital and medical school (University of London): original plan and statutes, rise and progress(1914), andThe Serbian epidemics of typhus and relapsing fever in 1915(1920). He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP London 1896) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and he was awarded an Honorary LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1927. William Hunter died on 13 January 1937.

Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In 1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890

Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.

The Scottish poet Sorley MacLean was born in Oscaig, Raasay, on 26 October 1911. He was educated locally and then at Portree High School. He studied English Literature at Edinburgh University from 1929, graduating in 1933 with a First. MacLean then began a teaching career, starting in Portree after qualifying from Moray House (teacher training college). Briefly between 1937-1938 he taught at Tobermoray Secondary School before returning to Edinburgh in 1939 to the English Department of Boroughmuir High School. In 1940, MacLean joined the Signals Corps and was posted to North Africa. He was seriously wounded at El Alamein in November 1942, and was invalided home to Scotland. He returned to his teaching post at Boroughmuir in 1943. In 1946 he married Renee Cameron. Although their life seemed settled in Edinburgh, and Sorley had been drawn into the literary circle of Douglas Young and his associates, which included George Campbell Hay, Norman McCaig, and especially Robert Garioch (Alastair Sutherland), he accepted the appointment of Headmaster at Plockton High School in 1956. MacLean's output included Seventeen Poems for Six-pence (with Garioch, 1940), Dain do Eimhir (1943), and co-authorship of Four Points of a Saltire (1970). He retired as Headmaster at Plockton in 1972 but then found himself drawn into a new educational experience, first as the Creative Writing Fellow at Edinburgh University (1973-5) and then as Filidh ('Poet') at the then embryonic Gaelic College at Sabhal Mor Ostaig (1975-6). Sorley MacLean died in Inverness on 24 November 1996.

Rev Thomas Allan was born on 16 August 1916 in Newmilnes, Ayrshire to William and Agnes. He was educated at Newmilnes Primary School and Kilmarnock Academy before going on to graduate from the University of Glasgow with a first class honours degree in English Literature. In 1945, following a number of years war service in the RAF he entered Trinity Theological College, Glasgow and was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1946.
In 1941 Tom Allan married Jane Moore and they had three children, Margaret Elizabeth, William Thomas and Kenneth John.
Rev Tom Allan's first charge was North Kelvinside Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1953 when he left to join the "Tell Scotland" movement. Tell Scotland started as a result of two Scottish radio missions of the BBC in which leading preachers of several denominations combined in a nation wide evangelistic drive. In 1953 the "Tell Scotland" committee was formed and Rev Tom Allan was appointed evangelistic organiser. He became a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century and travelled extensively throughout Britain in his capacity as evangelist for the Church of Scotland. In 1955 when Billy Graham held his 'All Scotland Crusade', Tom Allan was Chairman of the organizing committee.
In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

George Chalmers was born in Fochabers, in Moray, in 1742, and was educated in Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He studied Law at Edinburgh University. At the age of twenty-one he travelled with his uncle to America, to Maryland, and he practised law in Baltimore. On the outbreak of the American Civil War he returned to Britain, settling in London in 1775 where he began writing chiefly on political and colonial matters. In 1786 he was appointed to the Board of Trade as 'chief clerk of the committee of privy council for trade and foreign plantations'. He then turned to writing biography, publishing on Daniel Defoe, Thomas Paine and Thomas Ruddiman (Scottish grammarian and printer). In the 1800s he turned to the poetry and history of Scotland publishing poems of Allan Ramsay and Sir David Lyndsay. His works included: Annals of the present United Colonies (1780), Three tracts on Ireland (1785), Life of Daniel De Foe (1786), The poems of Allan Ramsay, with a Life of the author (1800), Caledonia starting in 1807, and Life of Mary Queen of Scots, drawn from the State Papers, with six subsidiary memoirs (1818).

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project ‚Äì not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a ¬£5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

The Scottish Widows Fund and Equitable Assurance Society, or Scottish Widows, was established in 1815 in Edinburgh. The idea for the setting up of a fund for the financial protection of the relatives of deceased clergyman and schoolmasters had been put forward by a group of prominent Scotsmen in March 1812. The fund would protect 'widows, sisters and other females' from poverty, and would be achieved by insuring capital sums on lives. The plan was extend the benefits of the fund to all parts of Britain. By September 1821, funds had reached ¬£20,000, and in 1845 they stood at ¬£1,700,000. In our own modern times Scottish Widows became part of Lloyds TSB Group.

John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.

Poet, essayist, literary critic, historian, and social commentator, Christopher Murray Grieve, also known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was born on 11 August 1892 in Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt. They were married in 1914 just after he had been appointed headmaster of the Burgh (now known as the Grammar) School in Kirkwall. During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. His published works include The Orkney Norn (1929), and posthumously Orkney Farm-Names (1952).  Dr Hugh Marwick died in Kirkwall on 21 May 1965.

In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

The Scottish poet, author and dramatist, George Mackay Brown, was born on 17 October 1921. His work has a distinctly Orcadian character and he is considered one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century. Brown had a long association with publishers Chatto and Windus. This had begun in 1959 when they published, under its Hogarth Press imprint, his second volume of poetry Loaves and Fishes. He remained with Chatto and Windus until 1984. It had been Hugo Brunner (Chatto and Windus) who first suggested that someone should write the story of his life, and the writer proposed was Maggie Fergusson. The job was done with Fergusson's The Life of George Mackay Brown published in 2006 by John Murray. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996. Hugo Brunner (Sir Hugo Lawrence Joseph Brunner) was born on 17 August 1935. His parents were Sir Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897-1982) and Dorothea Elizabeth, daughter of the Victorian era actor manager Henry Irving (1838-1905). Hugo Brunner was educated at Eton and he studied at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated with the degree of MA (Hons). Between 1958 and 1965, Brunner was with Oxford University Press and was OUP representative in Hong Kong, 1960-1962. From 1966 until 1976 he was Sales Director with Chatto and Windus, publishers. He returned to OUP in 1977 and was then back again at Chatto and Windus in 1979 as Managing Director, then Chairman, until 1985. Brunner has also been Director of Caithness Glass Ltd., 1966-1996, and Chairman 1984-1991. He has seen involvement with Brunner Investment Trust Plc., 1987-1999, and with SCM Press Ltd., 1991-1997.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on 6 March 1996.

Benjamin Franklin, born in Boston on 17 January 1706, was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, musician, inventor, satirist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He facilitated many civic organizations, including a fire department and a university. He was one of the United States Ministers to France from 1778-1785, and to Sweden from 1782-1783. He had been Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1764, and was the 6th President of Pennsylvania between 1785 and 1788. He had also been the first US Postmaster General. Dr. Benjamin Franklin died in Philadelphia on 17 April 1790. Benjamin Rush was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was born in Philadelphia on 4 January 1746. Rush lived in the state of Pennsylvania and was a physician, writer, educator, humanitarian, as well as the founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He studied at Princeton and at Edinburgh University. Rush signed the Declaration of Independence and attended the Continental Congress. He served as Surgeon General in the Continental army, and was blamed for criticising George Washington. Later in life, Rush became a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Benjamin Rush died in Philadelphia on 19 April 1813. Jonathan Potts was born in Pennsylvania in 1745. He studied at Edinburgh University (its Medical School). He had also studied at the first school of medicine in America, the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1768. He had been in the first graduating class. Dr. Potts was given command of the Fort George General Hospital, the single largest hospital in North America at the time. His efforts returned hundreds of men to the Continental Army at a critical moment in American history. He made a major and substantial contribution to American victory on Lake Champlain in 1776. Dr. Jonathan Potts died in 1781.

William Baird possibly had an association with Dysart in Fife, Scotland, in the seventeenth century. Within the manuscript, in its first part, there are a number of clues that supply a date to his life and indicate the Scottish origin of the item. Under an explanation of the Dominical Letter system for discovering the day of the week corresponding to any date is included a mnemonic beginning, 'At Dysart dwells George Bronn Esquire'. The inclusion of this mnemonic suggests that Baird was engaged in teaching mathematics to others and that he was doing so in Scotland. In addition to the reference to Dysart, there is also mention of Scottish money - 'Lib Scotts' - and a date of 1676 is supplied in another calculation. Dysart is a small town on the River Forth, on the northern shore of its large estuary. Dating from the 13th century, the town established itself in the middle of the 15th century as a trading port, exporting salt and coal to the Low Countries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. It had been towards the end of the 16th century that the first coal pit in the town was sunk - known as Lady Blanche. By the middle of the 17th century when coal began to surpass the salt trade, two new pits followed - Frances and Randolph. Two hundred years later, in 2009, there was no coal trade and no salt trade, and the community was a suburb of Kirkcaldy.

David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics.

Andrew Nisbet Bogle was born on 28 June 1868 in Callander, in central Scotland. He was the son of the Rev. Andrew Bogle (d. 1900), Minister of Callander Free Church, and Catherine Nisbet Bogle. He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh, and he studied at Edinburgh University where he was awarded his degree of M.A. in 1890. He also obtained the degree of D.D. from New College, Edinburgh, in 1923. Bogle was licensed by the Free Church Presbytery of Edinburgh in 1894, and he was an assistant at Edinburgh St. James'. In 1896 he was ordained and inducted to Larbert, Stirlingshire, on 19 March 1896. Also in 1896 he married Ellen Milne McCulloch. In July 1903, he translated to Leith North, in Ferry Rd., Edinburgh, but he resigned on his appointment in 1916 as Secretary to the Home Department No.1, Central Fund. In 1930, as Joint-Secretary, Church and Ministry Department, Andrew N. Bogle D.D. was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. In May 1937, the Very Rev. Andrew N. Bogle was one of two Ex-Moderators attending the Coronation of King George IV and Queen Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey, as a Representative of the Church of Scotland. The Very Rev. Andrew N. Bogle D.D. died on 5 August 1957.

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

The autobiography was finally published after J J Robertson had made use of Thomson's manuscripts in his lecture, Godfrey Thomson. This generated interest in the material, and after Hector's permission was given, Sir James Duff edited the manuscript, and W B Inglis wrote the last chapter, Edinburgh and Moray House, which Thomson had not managed to finish.

Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until 1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina Struthers. His publications includeA Concise Dictionary of musical terms(1884),Chopin as a man and musician(1888), andProgramme music in the last four centuries(1907), and Struthers edited hisRobert Schumannfor posthumous publication in 1925. He retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

James Campbell was born at Carsphairn (Dumfries and Galloway), on 16 July 1789, to William Campbell (1755-1829) and his wife Agnes (nee Riggs) (1760-1838). He studied for the ministry at Glasgow University (matriculated 1806) and was licensed by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright on 7 May 1817. He spent time as tutor to the Hart family of Castlemilk, and travelled to France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with them (around 1814). He was with them during their flight from France when Napoleon returned to power. On his return to Scotland he searched for a suitable parish, and became tutor to the family of Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie in Traquair parish. He was ordained as Minister of Traquair (Church of St. Bride) in September 1820, having been presented by George, Prince Regent, in January 1820. Campbell spent his whole ministerial career in Traquair. On 26 October 1820 James Campbell married Mary Combe (d. 1860), daughter of Matthew Combe, a Leith brewer. One of their daughters, Agnes Mary Campbell, married Jardine Wallace (1834-1910) who succeeded James Campbell as Minister at Traquair. James Campbell died on 29 April 1861, aged 71.

Alexander Crum Brown was born on 26 March 1838. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Mill Hill School, and he studied at the Universities of Edinburgh, Heidleberg and Marburg. He was an extra-academical Lecturer in Chemistry at the University, 1863-1869. Professor Crum Brown, as he was known, was one of the greatest holders of the University of Edinburgh's Chair of Chemistry, from 1869. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although kindly and popular he struggled to keep control of some rather riotous classes. He retired in 1908. Crum Brown was President of the Chemical Society of London, 1893-1893. Professor Alexander Crum Brown died on 28 October 1922. George Burns obtained a B.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1896.

Beale was working at this time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known). 'The genetics of Verbena I' appeared in the Journal of Genetics, 37 in 1939 and his collaborative paper with Rose Scott-Moncrieff and J.R. Price, 'The genetics of Verbena II: Chemistry of the flower colour variations' appeared in 1940.

Thomas Cunningham Penfold was born on 14 October 1872 in Brampton, Cumberland. He was the son of John Blake Penfold, a painter, and Marianne Penfold (formerly Cunningham) and twin brother of Henry Penfold. Penfold studied at Edinburgh University, graduating M.B., C.M. in 1894. He then went on to study for his M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (London) and the D.T.H. (Dublin), and then set himself up in private medical practice at Benwell, Newcastle. He was joined by another brother, Dr. W. J. Penfold who later became Director of the Baker Institute, Melbourne, Australia. After several years in practice Penfold began to follow up an interest in public health work, and in 1910 he was appointed as Medical Officer to the Isolation Hospital, Prudhoe, and was also Medical Officer in Hexham. In 1914 he became Medical Officer of Health to the Bishop Auckland Rural District Council and in 1925 he moved to Chester-le-Street as Medical Officer of Health and Medical Officer of the Chester-le-Street Isolation Hospital. While in post he was involved in the moves towards slum clearance in the rural area of Chester-le-Street and he also campaigned for the creation of healthy schools and healthy homes for children so that infectious diseases could be reduced. Dr. Thomas Cunningham Penfold died suddenly in a Newcastle nursing home on 13 May 1935, leaving a widow and three daughters.

Henry Stewart Noel McFarland was born in Perth on 25 December 1924. He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946.  McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning.  Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK.  McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham. He passed away suddenly in 1973, aged 48.

He acknowledges that modern research is in reality constrained by input from collaborators or funders. Thomson discusses how research bodies such as the National Foundation and the Scottish Council for Research in Education can help the researcher in a variety of ways, including not limiting the researcher with too many or too exacting instructions, not demanding too quick a return, and involving the researcher in the design of experiments. He explores team work and co-operation, giving the Scottish Mental Surveys as an example, and emphasises the importance of strong, inspirational, and collaborative leadership. He also discusses the responsibilities of the researcher undertaking individual research, including the design of experiments and the utilising of research tools such as statistics; and the supposed dichotomy of fundamental and operational research. The lecture is written on the reverse side of headed paper from the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology. Edinburgh, 23rd July-29th July.

In the letter he says that the essay 'is very generally attributed to Sir Matthew Decker'.

He asks if she knows of any papers remaining 'which prove that Mr. Richardson wrote this essay, or anything else'. Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679-1749) was an English merchant and writer on trade, an MP, and director of the East India Company.

Thomson also mentions a child who was tested and subsequently given a place in secondary school, and who wrote to him many years later to let him know he had won the gold medal at the end of his university course.

The letter was written by Hugh MacDiarmid on 30 August 1958 from 'Brownsbank', Candymill, Biggar, Lanarkshire. It is addressed to Dr. Ringsleben - Mary Ringsleben having been awarded her Ph.D. two years earlier in 1956 (Aberdeen). MacDiarmid apologises for having 'retained your thesis so long'. He refers to having seen Dr. David Murison (deputy editor of the Scottish National Dictionary) in Edinburgh and that he had 'just missed you'. He describes the Ringsleben thesis as 'an excellent one and certainly the best thing written on Douglas by far'. He goes on to say that he is 'not going to make any little critical observations' apart from 'wishing to see it expanded and published'. Because it is 'on the short side for a book', he hopes she 'may decide to expand it'. MacDiarmid agrees 'in toto with all the main substance' of the study, and hopes that other subjects in Scots literature may attract her attention.

The lecture was delivered to a wide audience, and is designed to be understood by non-statisticians, and non-educators. In it, Thomson explores the uses and limitations of statistics in both education and psychology, illustrating his points with examples of how an educator might effectively predict a child's performance and offer vocational guidance appropriate to their ability and intelligence.  Thomson discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample and the effect sampling bias has on investigations of causation, and highlights some of the difficulties in obtaining a sample and how these might be overcome. He also touches upon the use of statistics to inform the raising of the school age, and explores the use of statistical methods in collating examination marks to provide indicators of intelligence and predictors of future career success. He highlights the value in using statistical techniques, particularly the concept of distribution, to enhance teachers' ratings of pupils' ability and to enable direct comparison across age groups. He describes intelligence tests as a less subjective indication of future career and performance, while also discussing the phenomenon that an individual's test results in all tests, whether intelligence, dexterity, or vocational fitness, tend to be positively correlated.

The letter was written when Spence was 17-years old. He writes, 'In parting with you I part from a friend, and I hope you will not take it as an insult when I say that I have a greater liking for you than I ever had for any of my companions'. He hopes Forbes reached home safely, and he is looking forward to seeing his own parents soon: 'They will leave Constantinople about the first week of April'. He has been up at the school 'paying the V a general visit'. Spence goes on to talk about the forthcoming 'Interscholastic Games at Corstorphine' to be held on 13 April 1889, and how 'Wilson is going in for the long drop at the Interscholastic' and how he 'was thinking of going in for the half mile handicap' at their own School Games to be held on the same day. Additionally, some local historical information is provided in that there is a reference to Jessie King who 'was executed in the Calton Jail on Monday morning. She took things very coolly to the very last', he writes.

The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

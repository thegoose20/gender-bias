Rev Thomas Allan was born on 16 August 1916 in Newmilnes, Ayrshire to William and Agnes. He was educated at Newmilnes Primary School and Kilmarnock Academy before going on to graduate from the University of Glasgow with a first class honours degree in English Literature. In 1945, following a number of years war service in the RAF he entered Trinity Theological College, Glasgow and was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1946.
In 1941 Tom Allan married Jane Moore and they had three children, Margaret Elizabeth, William Thomas and Kenneth John.
Rev Tom Allan's first charge was North Kelvinside Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1953 when he left to join the "Tell Scotland" movement. Tell Scotland started as a result of two Scottish radio missions of the BBC in which leading preachers of several denominations combined in a nation wide evangelistic drive. In 1953 the "Tell Scotland" committee was formed and Rev Tom Allan was appointed evangelistic organiser. He became a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century and travelled extensively throughout Britain in his capacity as evangelist for the Church of Scotland. In 1955 when Billy Graham held his 'All Scotland Crusade', Tom Allan was Chairman of the organizing committee.
In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

David Brewster was born in Jedburgh on 11 December 1781, and was attending Edinburgh University classes at the age of twelve in 1793. It was his ambition to go into the Church. Indeed, Brewster gave his first sermon in March 1804 but nervousness led him to abandon this career. That year he became tutor to a family in Dumfriesshire and he remained there until 1807 while he pursued scientific studies and the study of literature.  In 1807, Brewster was a candidate for the Chair of Mathematics at St. Andrews University, but without success. In 1813, he submitted a paper to the Royal Society of London on Some properties of light and the same year he published a Treatise on new philosophical instruments. In 1814, illness prompted him to visit Paris and Geneva and on his return to Britain he continued publishing. In 1815, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1816, Brewster invented the kaleidoscope and although he patented the invention, it was quickly pirated because of a fault in the registration. He published his Treatise on the kaleidoscope in 1819.  Together with the mineralogist Professor Robert Jameson, he edited the Edinburgh philosophical journal, previously called the Edinburgh magazine, and in 1819 when the name changed again to the Edinburgh journal of science he was the sole editor. In 1820, Brewster became a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and in 1821 he was active in the formation of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts of which he became director. In 1822, he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In December 1837, he became the Principal of the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard at St. Andrews University. In 1859 he became Principal of Edinburgh University. Sir David Brewster died from an attack of pneumonia at Allerly, Melrose, on 10 February 1868.

During this time his correspondants included his brother Donald Macpherson Baillie, Henry Sloane Coffin, Frederick Carlos Ferry, Jacob Gould Schurman, Hugh Ross Mackintosh (including correspondence about the vacancy at Auburn) and David Smith Cairns.
|
John Baillie was born in 1886, the son of Rev John Baillie ( 1829-1891), Free Church minister at Gairloch, Ross & Cromarty in the north-west of Scotland, and his wife Annie Macpherson. John (senior) was a graduate of both the University of Edinburgh and Free Church College, Edinburgh Following the death of his father in 1891, the family home was at Inverness and John (junior) was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force. The end of that war saw his marriage to Florence Jewel Fowler and the start of his academic career. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retrial six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches; he became a President of the latter. John Baillie's brother, Donald Macpherson Baillie ( 1887-1954) was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and at the Universities of Edinburgh, Marburg and Heidelberg. He graduated with an MA from New College Edinburgh in 1909, and he spent some time with the YMCA in France before being ordained in 1918 and was minister of Bervie United Free Church until 1923. Moving to St. John's, Cupar he was there until 1930 and then at St. Columba's, Kilmacolm until 1934. Donald was appointed Kerr lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1923, delivering lectures in 1926. In 1935 he became Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of St Andrews, where he had been Additional examiner for the BD degree in Divinity and Ecclesiastical History from 1921-1924, and which had awarded him an Honorary DD in 1933. Other academic positions included External Examiner for the BD in Divinity at the University of Edinburgh from 1933, Forwood lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion at the University of Liverpool, 1947, and Moore lecturer at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, 1952. John and Donald's brother, Peter Baillie ( 1889-1914), was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and then at George Watson's College. Entering Edinburgh University in 1907, he graduated with a M.B., Ch.B. in 1912. For many years he was a member of the Philomathic Society and became its President in 1911. He was senior house surgeon at Mildmay Mission Hospital, London, for six months and in January 1914 he left Britain for Jalna, India, taking up a post to which he had been appointed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the United Free Church. He was ordained as a missionary elder of Langside Hill United Free Church, Glasgow, prior to his departure. While in India he was the victim of a drowning at Mahableshwar.

At University he followed classes in English and British History between 1939 and 1940, English and Philosophy from 1940 to 1941, then Latin, Psychology and Geography from 1941 to 1942. War service presumably followed because he did not graduate with the degree of MA until June 1946. Thereafter he was awarded the diploma and degree of Dip.Ed. (1947) and B.Ed. (1948). Anne Hyslop Gemmell was born in Coalburn, Lanarkshire, on 16 June 1923. She was educated at Ormiston Public School and at schools in Wishaw and Cumnock.

Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.

From 1944 to 1946 she taught Mathematics at Mount School in York. In 1946 she came to Edinburgh to follow the B.Ed. course at the University of Edinburgh under Professor Godfrey Thomson. She was awarded the degree of B.Ed. in 1948. The following year she accepted a post at the Brighton College of Education teaching education and psychology. The experience was an unhappy one for Taylor, who resigned after one term. She wrote to Thomson explaining her predicament, and was offered a position at his education research unit, known as 'Room 70', undertaking administrative work on the Moray House Tests as well as holding the post of assistant lecturer at Moray House training college.  During her time at Moray House, Taylor worked as a Fulbright Scholar at the Educational Testing Service in New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures. In 1952, Taylor was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to spend a year at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this year was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures.  Taylor's post at the Godfrey Thomson Research Unit terminated in 1956, and she became warden of Playfair Hall in East Suffolk Road, Edinburgh, a hall of residence for female Moray House students. During this time, she also worked as a tutor for first year Mathematics students. In 1964, she accepted the post of deputy secretary at the North Regional Examinations Board for the Certificate of Secondary Education, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She remained in this post until 1982, when she retired and moved to Orkney.

The 'Field of Mars' (or Marsovo Polye) is a large park named after Mars - the Roman god of war - and situated in the centre of St. Petersburg, Russia. At the time of the city's founding in the 18th century, the site was called the 'Grand Meadow', and military solemnities in the honour of victory in the Great Northern War against Sweden were held there. Later, it was renamed 'Pleasure Field' (Poteshnoe Polye), and in the 1740s it was turned into a park with paths, lawn and flowers. When Rastrelli was commissioned to build a Summer Palace for Empress Catherine I, the field was again renamed, this time as 'Tsarina's Meadow'. By the end of the 18th century 'Tsarina's Meadow' became a military drilling ground, and monuments to Russian victories were erected there including one to Alexander Suvorov in 1801. It became known as the 'Field of Mars' in 1805.

The letter was written in St. Petersburg, on Grande Morskaia (Bolshaia Morskaia, or Morskaya Street), on 2nd or 15th May 1901, by W. Sedgefield, and addressed to his 'Dear Uncle', W. J. Sedgefield, Esq., Abingdon, Berkshire, England. The envelope, with franking and partial postage stamp, survives. The letter describes the 'annual spring parade of the troops quartered in and around St. P[etersburg]' which took place 'yesterday' - yesterday being 1 May 1901 - on the 'Field of Mars'. Sedgefield was accompanied by ' an intelligent Russian boy', a pupil of his, and whose male relatives were soldiers - 'fathers and uncles being generals and his brothers officers in crack regiments'. The parade took place in front of the Emperor. 'After a long wait the Emperor appeared riding along side of a state carriage drawn by white horses, containing the two Empresses'. One of these ladies was presumably the Empress Dowager.  The letter contains descriptions of the regiments involved in the parade, and description of the horses involved.

This autograph letter signed is dated 22 November 1937, and it was written from 'Seamark', Lloyd Road, Hove, Sussex, and addressed to 'My dear Ballie'. The letter regrets that he 'did not see' Baillie last August but that he he will 'have better luck next year'. He has the hope though that he 'will pay me a visit here some day'. The letter accompanied 'this book' - presumably Nicodemus. A mystery (1937). He suggests that if 'you like it at all you may have a chance of suggesting the play for performance'. He believes that in England 'at least' the religious drama 'has a future'. If Baillie is ever to happen to write to him he asks if 'in one word' he might be told 'what people like yourself think of Dunne's Experiment with Time as a proof of Immortality'.

This MS letter, addressed to 'Dear Sir', was written by Violet Jacob at Domaine de la Congue, Vence, in the Alpes Maritimes, France, on 6 April [no year] and presumably in 1936, given the reference in the letter to 'the honour done'. 1936 was the year in which she received the LL.D. from Edinburgh University. Domaine de la Congue is the location of a French 'Maison de retraite', a sanatorium for veterans today. The letter tells of how the letter reached her 'after various adventures' and that there has been a 'delay in answering it'. She continues: 'I cannot say how kind I think it of you to write. You tell me that there are countrymen of mine who will regard the honour done by Edinburgh University as a personal honour to themselves. All the degrees in Europe could not counterbalance that in my eyes'.

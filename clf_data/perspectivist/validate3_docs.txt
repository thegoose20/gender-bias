Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English, University College Swansea. During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military communication Enigma codes. After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics.A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English, or LALME, was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist methodology in the study of the linguistic history. McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and this resulted in the publication in 1952 of hisIntroduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. In the same year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a tireless supporter of both theScottish National Dictionaryand theDictionary of the Older Scottish Tongueor DOST. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh University, both founded by McIntosh, merged.

The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829. He renewed his contact with the composer later in Berlin and elsewhere on the continent, also making the acquaintance of Schumann.

Margaret Winifred Bartholomew was born on 21 August 1885 at Duntarvie, West Lothian, just over a dozen miles west of Edinburgh. She was the third of the five children of John and Agnes Bartholomew. Her father was a farmer and her mother a musician. She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies College between 1895 and 1903, and then she studied at the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, 1903-1908, graduating with the degrees of M.B. and Ch.B. from Edinburgh University, 1908. Her aunt, Dr. Isabella Mears, a missionary in China, was one of the first ten women to become a doctor in Britain. From 1908, and for a year, Bartholomew worked as an Assistant in General Practice, and then in 1909 she gained a post as a Medical Missionary in the Womens Hospital, Nagpur, India where she carried out surgical work and midwifery. In 1914, she returned to Scotland, and on the outbreak of war took over her brother's medical practice near Edinburgh. In 1915 however, in November, she had returned to India, and in Bombay married Frank Rushworth who was at that time a Captain in the 7th Rajputs, an Indian Regiment stationed in the North West Frontier. By the end of the year though, Rushforth had been sent to Mesopotamia. In 1916, Winifred was working in the Mission Hospital, Jalna, in central India, doing surgical work and inoculations against bubonic plague and cholera. In 1917, her husband returned to India to a government post in Simla, and she did surgical work in a womens hospital there. In 1920 they moved to Calcutta, where Frank worked in business and Winifred was a volunteer worker organising infant welfare work and started child guidance with mothers groups. For this work, Rushforth received the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal (Emperor of India Medal). In 1929, in London, she underwent training at the Tavistock Clinic beginning a personal analysis and carrying out analytic treatment of patients. By 1931, the Depression had ended her husband's career in Calcutta and so the family settled in Edinburgh where he worked as Registrar at the Edinburgh College of Art. Rushforth continued with personal analysis and in 1933 began work as an analytical psycho-therapist in private practice in Edinburgh - at this time, very much pioneer work in Scotland. In 1939, just as the War started, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was joined by Dr. Elspeth Macleod - a child therapist - and several of her own patients who had teaching and other qualifications, and opened a small clinic with the support of a Presbyterian congregation. This was the Davidson Clinic. Her confidence in analytic psycho-therapy was strengthened by the arrival in Scotland of Jewish refugee psychiatrists from Germany, and one of them, Dr. William Kraemer, joined her in 1941 and they worked together for sixteen years establishing the Davidson Clinic. During the wartime years, and after, the Clinic flourished, and as other doctors and clinicians associated themselves with it, psycho-therapists were able to be trained. As far as patients were concerned - and as concerned the analytical work - at one time as many as 100 patients were being treated daily. Then, with the passing of the Mental Health Act (1959), and the re-organisation of the mental hospitals across the UK, the treatment of neurosis and psycho-therapy was taken over by the State and new era of treatment began using barbiturate drugs and tranquillisers. Unable to offer comparable salaries to those offered by the National Health Service (NHS) it became impossible to recruit psychiatric staff, and so the Davidson Clinic was not able to survive. From its inception in 1939 and until 1965, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was the Honorary Medical Director of the Davidson Clinic. On the death of her successor, she returned to the Clinic to wind up its affairs. Then, in 1967, Rushforth was awarded the OBE in recognition for her work. From 1965 until her death she continued her private practice in psycho-therapy working both with individual patients and also with Dream-Growth groups. In addition, Easter and Summer schools were held after 1965 and out of these the Sempervivum Trust emerged. Rushforth also provided inspiration to the work of the Salisbury Centre, Edinburgh (1973), and of Wellspring, Edinburgh (1978). In 1981, at the age of ninety-five, she published Something is happening: spiritual awareness and depth psychology in the new age. It was first published in London by the Turnstone Press. Another work was Ten decades of happenings (1984), which was an autobiography. After her death, Life's Currency: Time, Money and Energy: An Anthology of Shorter Writings (1986) was published. Dr. Winifred Rushforth died at her home in Edinburgh on 29 August 1983. Sir Laurens van der Post attended Dr Rushforth's Memorial Service in Old St Paul's Church, Edinburgh, as Prince Charles's representative. Earlier that year, the Prince and Princess of Wales had visited her in her home.

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

The 'Donaldson report' was a report from an expert group established by the government and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson. The group was asked to undertake an assessment of the anticipated benefits of new areas of research using human embryos, the risks and alternatives, and ultimately, to advise whether these new areas of research should be permitted. The report, 'Stem Cell Research: medical progress with responsibility', was published by the Department of Health in June 2000. The report concluded that research was warranted across a range of sources of stem cells, and that it did not raise any new ethical issues different from those already raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research. The report was followed by a response from the government in August 2000, which accepted all the report's recommendations and undertook to introduce regulations to extend the permitted research purposes under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and to set out unequivocally in legislation the existing ban on reproductive cloning.

Allan Maconochie, the Scottish judge, was born on 26 January 1748. He was the son of Alexander and Isabella Maconochie, Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton (now in West Lothian), to the west of Edinburgh. He was privately educated by Dr. Alexander Adam (1741-1809) who later on became Rector of the Royal High School in the city. Maconochie then studied at Edinburgh University taking the classes of Adam Fergusson, Professor of Moral Philosophy, and Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. He also studied Roman Law with the Professor of Civil Law, Robert Dick, from 1766 to 1769. He was then apprenticed to Thomas Tod, a well-known Writer to the Signet. During this period he co-founded the Speculative Society, an institution which 'trained' young men in 'public speaking, talent, and liberal thought'. On the conclusion of his studies in 1768, he went to Paris for a short time. In 1770 he became an Advocate and in Spring 1771 was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn, though he was never called to the English Bar. In 1773, he returned to France. On 11 November 1774, Maconochie married Elizabeth Welwood, a daughter of Robert Welwood of Garvock and Pitliver, Fife, and grand-daughter of Sir George Preston of Valleyfield. Also in 1774 he was elected to the General Assembly as a lay representative of the Burgh of Dunfermline. On 16 July 1779 Maconochie was appointed Professor of Public Law and Law of Nature at Edinburgh University, and also in 1779 he was elected Treasurer of the Faculty of Advocates. At the University, he advertised classes each year until he resigned the Chair in 1796. In 1788 he became Sheriff-Depute of Renfrewshire, and in 1796 he succeeded the judge and essayist Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby (1745–1795) as an ordinary Lord of Session taking his seat on the Bench on 11 March as Lord Meadowbank. Maconochie had also been a keen agriculturalist and he wrote anonymously theDirections for preparing manure from peat, and instructions for foresters(1802) which was reprinted in 1815 and 1842. Other publications includedConsiderations on the introduction of jury trial in civil cases into Scotland(1814) andEssay on the origin and structure of the European legislatures(1788). A portrait of Maconochie was said to have been painted by Sir Henry Raeburn in 1814. Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, died at Coates House, near Edinburgh, on 14 June 1816. He was buried in the private burial-ground on the Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton.

Geoffrey McKay Gibbon was born in Scarborough on 16 July 1896. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and obtained the degrees of M.B., Ch.B. in 1920. He was registered in Scotland on 8 July 1920. In the 1920s he was living in Elgin and Forres in Scotland, but in the early 1930s he was in Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire, England. It was at this point in his career that when requested by the Registrar of the General Medical Council (Scottish Branch) for notification of any changes to his qualifications, Gibbon's wife informed the Registrar that in September 1931 her husband 'was appointed Surgeon to the R.R.S. 'Discovery II' ' and that he would be absent from the UK for 2-years. The Royal Research Ship 'Discovery II', which had been built in 1929, had sailed from London with Gibbon on board on 3 October 1931 on its second Antarctic commission. The purpose of the expedition was research into the economic resources of the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies in the southern ocean, and more particularly into the most important of these resources at the time: the whale populations and the whaling industry of the waters of the latter, and beyond. The ship had been under the command of Lieut. A. L. Nelson R.N.R. and Comdr. W. M. Carey R.N. (retired), and surveyed from the Magellan Strait to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and then in the oceans around South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. By 1934 Gibbon was working for the Cyprus Medical Service, and in the 1940s he was with the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda. In 1954, the Medical register indicated that he was residing in the Port Elizabeth area of South Africa. Latterly, in the early-1960s (1962), Gibbon lived in Lympstone, Devon. His name ceased to appear in the Medical register after 1983.

The prolific writer, editor and compiler Josiah Conder was born in Aldersgate, London, on 17 September 1789, the son of a map engraver and bookseller, Thomas Conder. At the age of ten his first essay was published in The Monthly Preceptor, and on reaching thirteen, he began work as an assistant in the family's City bookshop. In 1811, at the age of twenty-one, he took it over. Shortly afterwards, Josiah married Joan Elizabeth Thomas (Eliza Thomas). He had initially formed a literary association with her in 1810 to jointly contribute to the book The associate minstrels. Josiah Conder was a close friend of the engraver and educationalist Isaac Taylor (1759-1829) and his wife, and Conder addressed poems to them both, having been a regular visitor to their home. Another of Conder's earlier works was The withered oak (1806), otherwise The reverie (1811), The star in the east (1824), A dictionary of geography (1834), The epistle to the Hebrews, a new translation, with notes (1834), The congregational hymnbook (1834), The literary history of the New testament (1845) and The harmony of history with prophecy, an explanation of the Apocalypse (1849) are among the publications of which he was author, editor or compiler.

In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.

George Chalmers was born in Fochabers, in Moray, in 1742, and was educated in Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He studied Law at Edinburgh University. At the age of twenty-one he travelled with his uncle to America, to Maryland, and he practised law in Baltimore. On the outbreak of the American Civil War he returned to Britain, settling in London in 1775 where he began writing chiefly on political and colonial matters. In 1786 he was appointed to the Board of Trade as 'chief clerk of the committee of privy council for trade and foreign plantations'. He then turned to writing biography, publishing on Daniel Defoe, Thomas Paine and Thomas Ruddiman (Scottish grammarian and printer). In the 1800s he turned to the poetry and history of Scotland publishing poems of Allan Ramsay and Sir David Lyndsay. His works included: Annals of the present United Colonies (1780), Three tracts on Ireland (1785), Life of Daniel De Foe (1786), The poems of Allan Ramsay, with a Life of the author (1800), Caledonia starting in 1807, and Life of Mary Queen of Scots, drawn from the State Papers, with six subsidiary memoirs (1818). George Chalmers died on 31 May 1825.

Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt.

During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

In 1812, Napoleon had invaded Russia with the aim of forcing Tsar Alexander I to remain in the Continental System and to remove a threatened Russian invasion of Poland. His Grand Army crossed the River Niemen in June 1812 and the Battle of Borodino followed in September 1812 ending in a tactical defeat for the Russians and the opening of the road to Moscow for Napoleon. By 14 September, Moscow had been captured but the Russians had largely abandoned the city. The Tsar refused to capitulate and the city Governor ordered the burning of Moscow. Without a clear victory, Napoleon began the retreat from Moscow and a return to Paris. In the Moscow Campaign, Napoleon had lost 380,000 men and another 100,000 had been captured, and seeing an opportunity, Prussia, Sweden, Austria and a number of German States re-entered the war. Major battles in Germany in 1813 included Luetzen and Bautzen in May 1813, Dresden in August 1813, and the Battle of Leipzig (the Battle of the Nations) in October 1813. Napoleon would subsequently lose the French Campaign in 1814, and go into exile on Elba briefly before being defeated finally at Waterloo in 1815. The description of events near Sottrum, North Germany - between Ottersberg and Rotenburg, just to the southwest of Hamburg - which is the focus of the material of this collection, can be read in the context of events in Germany at the time, and just prior to the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The description appears to have been written 50 years after the event and tells of the rout of between six thousand and eight thousand French troops by a handful of Hamburg volunteers and cossacks.

For the Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd., Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades from 1921. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times.  The 'Empress of Britain' of the 1950 and 1960s was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain', the 25,526 ton ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II at Govan on 22 June 1955. The ship was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963.  Verna Isaac, of Wichita, Kansas, sailed on the 'Empress of Britain' (Tourist Class) on Tuesday 22 August 1961 westbound across the Atlantic from Liverpool to Montreal where it arrived on 29 August. The sailing was via Greenock and Quebec.

John Webster Lowson Spence was born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) in 1871, the son of a Church of Scotland missionary, the Rev David Brown Spence, who later moved to Constantinople. The younger Spence went to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating in 1898. After an earlier association with Wilhelm Roentgen (discoverer of X-rays, 1895), radiology became his speciality, first as an assistant in the new electrical department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then, from 1907, as head of the electrical and radiological department of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children where he remained for 22 years. Because of the lack of protection available in these early years of working with X-rays - and indeed lack of understanding of the damage that they could do - Spence soon showed signs of illness and damage and between 1910 and 1916 he had to undergo amputations. In 1922 he was awarded a bronze medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund with an annuity of £130 in recognition of his work in radiology. A few years after his death his name was inscribed on a memorial erected in the garden of St. George's Hospital in Hamburg (April 1936) by the German Roentgen Society to honour those X-ray pioneers who had sacrificed their health or their lives in the interests of their work. John Webster Lowson Spence died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1930, aged only 58.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959.

The Dutch marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger was born in 1633 and baptised in Leiden, Holland, in the Dutch Republic. He was a son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, also a marine painter. The younger van de Velde, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute, and had achieved great celebrity in his art before he came to London. In 1673 he moved to England, where he was engaged by Charles II, at a salary of £100, to aid his father in 'taking and making draughts of sea-fights'. His part of the work was to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder van de Velde. He was also patronised by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility. Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. Willem van de Velde the Younger died on 6 April 1707 in London, England and was buried at St. James's Church. The MP John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor, was born on 8 November 1790.

Duncan Forbes was born on 10 November 1685, the second son of Duncan Forbes of Culloden and Bunchrew, near Inverness. He went to Edinburgh University to study law, but in 1705 proceeded to Leiden instead to study civil law and oriental languages, returning to Scotland in 1707. He was admitted as an advocate in 1709, and was also appointed Sheriff of Midlothian around the same time. During the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, his brother John Forbes (who had joined with Simon Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat) accompanied him to Inverness where they raised forces in support of the government. Duncan was rewarded with the office of Depute-Advocate which he took up in 1716. In 1721-22, Forbes was MP for Ayr, and in 1722 he was returned in Inverness. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Advocate in succession to Robert Dundas of Arniston. As the English system of taxation was extended into Scotland troubles began to arise and rioting took place in Glasgow in 1725. Forbes accompanied a force commanded by General Wade, and the Glasgow magistrates were arrested for their negligence and brought to Edinburgh with some of the rioters. They were later freed. Edinburgh too suffered trouble within the brewing industry at this time. In 1735, Forbes succeeded to the family estates on the death of his brother. In 1737 he opposed the Bill bringing penalties on the City of Edinburgh after the Porteous Riots. In the wake of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, he protested against the cruelties of the Duke of Cumberland. Duncan Forbes died on 10 December 1747.

It has the oldest full-time Chair of Art History in Britain which was founded in 1880. History of Art is located at Minto House, 20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, opposite the Royal Museum of Scotland, and within easy walking distance of most of the galleries and museums of central Edinburgh. History of Art has book, slide and photographic collections, as well as a photographic unit. There is also a laboratory for the demonstration of metalworking techniques and methods of conservation. A collection of postcards in photo albums and small file drawers was gathered together by members of Fine Art staff (in the Department's early years) for use as teaching aids before the advent of the popular colour slide format. The early postcard collection is important in that the cards are primarily of European buildings, many of which were lost or damaged during the revolutions and conflicts of the 20th century.

He went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Medical Society. In his specialism of veneorology, publications include the jointly written 'Penicillin in gonnorhea and syphilus' in the British Medical Journal in 1945, and 'Middle East granuloma' in the British Journal of Venereal Diseases also in 1945.

It was built by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson (1834-1921) between 1888 and 1897 in Italian Renaissance style, and originally planned as part of the University's new Medical School. It was funded by William McEwan, the brewer, and is used as a graduation, concert, meeting and examination hall. From the early-1990s there had been a study into the refurbishment of the Hall and into the extension of its functions.

Walter Ledermann was born on 18 Mar 1911, the second of William and Charlotte Ledermann's four children, in Berlin, Germany. His Father was a physician, though the family was accustomed to poverty following World War I and the depression of the 1920s. Ledermann was a promising student from an early age, and a keen violinist. He received his leaving certificate from the Leibniz Gymnasium early due to his performance in classics and mathematics, which allowed him to complete his degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Berlin. There he encountered several mathematicians and physicists of note who inspired him, including Issai Schur, Heinz Hopf, Max Plank, and Erwin Shrodinger.  On completion of his degree, it became clear to Ledermann that he could no longer stay in Germany. He won a scholarship created by students at St Andrews to support a Jewish refugee, during which time his brother was working in Edinburgh to gain a medical qualification. Ledermann was awarded his PhD after two years.  Encouraged by Professor Turnbull of St Andrews University, Ledermann sought an interview with Professor Edmund Whittaker (later Sir) at the University of Edinburgh with a view to seeking employment there. Whittaker invited him to come as a visiting student to Edinburgh for one term, offering him a bursary of £50 and encouraging him to attend the lectures of A C Aitken. Aitken quickly became a friend to Ledermann, and introduced him to Godfrey Thomson, Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and Director of Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). At that time, Thomson required a mathematical assistant for a Carnegie funded project which would eventually result in the publication of his seminal book, The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and he immediately offered Ledermann the post. It is from this period that the majority of Ledermann's papers, which largely comprise of letters from Thomson, were created. Ledermann's work with Thomson was interrupted for 6 months in 1937 when Ledermann accepted a post teaching at the University of Dundee. He returned to work with Thomson in Edinburgh until 1938, when he took a lecturer's post in the University of St Andrews. In 1940, Ledermann's naturalization was completed, and he was also awarded his DSc from the University of Edinburgh. He married his wife, Ruth Ledermann, a social worker, in 1946, later having a son, Jonathon. The couple moved to Manchester, where Ledermann was worked as a lecturer in pure mathematics in the University of Manchester, from 1946-1962.  In 1962 Ledermann gained a lecture post at the new University of Sussex, where he eventually became a professor. He found the atmosphere of the modern university highly stimulating, and taught for two further years past the statutory age of retirement (then 65). Even after his official retirement in 1978, Ledermann continued to give occasional courses and revision classes to his students until 1997, when he and Ruth, by then a psychotherapist, moved to London. Ledermann died in London on 22 May 2009.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

J. L. Levison lived for a time in Hull, England. He was the author of Mental culture, or, The means of developing the human faculties, published in 1883, and printed for Levison and sold by Jackson and Walford, London, and also of Practical observations on the teeth and gums with the best means for their preservation published in 1838 by Longman, London.  George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788, the son of a brewer. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in the Edinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

John Pitcairn Mackintosh was born on 24 August 1929, in Simla, India. He was educated at Melville College in Edinburgh and the studied at Edinburgh University where he attended the lectures of, among others, Dr. Balfour-Melville. He also studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and at Princeton. Mackintosh went on to become an Assistant Lecturer at Glasgow University, 1953-54, Lecturer in History, Edinburgh University, 1954-61, Senior Lecturer in Government at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, 1961-63, and he was Senior Lecturer in Politics at Glasgow University, 1963-65, and Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde, 1965-66. Later in his life, 1977, he became part-time Professor and Head of the Department of Politics at the University of Edinburgh. He had a political career too, contesting Edinburgh Pentlands for the Labour Party in 1959, and Berwick and East Lothian in 1964. He became MP for Berwick and East Lothian in 1966 succeeding William Anstruther-Gray, but in the February 1974 election he was defeated by the Conservative Michael Ancram. He regained it again in the second 1974 election, in October. Mackintosh was fierce proponent of devolution in Scotland. His publications include The British cabinet (1962), Nigerian goverment and politics (1966), The devolution of power (1968), and The government and politics of Britain (1970). In addition he edited British prime-ministers in the twentieth century, Vol.1: Balfour to Chamberlain  (1970) and British prime-ministers in the twentieth century, Vol.2: Churchill to Callaghan (1978). Mackintosh was also a freelance writer and television commentator. John Pitcairn Mackintosh MP (Labour) died in office on 30 July 1978. He was succeeded in his constituency by John Home Robertson.

The first Veterinary School in Edinburgh was founded by William Dick in 1823. Successful students at the School were presented with certificates from the Highland and Agricultural Society from 1828. In 1856, John Gamgee was appointed to the Veterinary School as an assistant to William Dick. Gamgee left the following year to open his own New Veterinary School in Edinburgh. The New Veterinary School moved to Bayswater, London, in 1865, where it became the Albert Veterinary College. It closed in 1868. A New Veterinary College was opened in Edinburgh by William Williams in 1873, but this too moved - to Liverpool in 1904 where it became the Veterinary School of the University of Liverpool.

The lecture explores how schools could, and should, benefit the whole community by giving pupils a happy, clean environment which serves as a model for what the home should be, and by giving them the knowledge and skills in order to work towards solving practical and social problems in their communities.  He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

Three copies of manuscript letters from Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) to Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji are dated 25 May 1926 from Montrose, 5 January 1932 from London, and 19 August 1955 from Lanarkshire. The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

At E2010.24 there is an autograph letter signed from Marwick to Professor Bruce Dickins, placed and dated as Alton (Kirkwall), 26 January 1965. The letter was written around 3-4 months before his death and is autobiographical. The content is largely reminiscenses about his time at Edinburgh University.

Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.

Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates.

Mainly letters (7) of thanks for gifts (Millais, to Mrs Cowper, of 17 Carson Street), or accepting or declining invitations (Rosetti and Ruskin).Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English, University College Swansea. During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military communication Enigma codes. After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics.A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English, or LALME, was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist methodology in the study of the linguistic history. McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and this resulted in the publication in 1952 of hisIntroduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. In the same year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a tireless supporter of both theScottish National Dictionaryand theDictionary of the Older Scottish Tongueor DOST. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh University, both founded by McIntosh, merged.

The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829. He renewed his contact with the composer later in Berlin and elsewhere on the continent, also making the acquaintance of Schumann.

Margaret Winifred Bartholomew was born on 21 August 1885 at Duntarvie, West Lothian, just over a dozen miles west of Edinburgh. She was the third of the five children of John and Agnes Bartholomew. Her father was a farmer and her mother a musician. She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies College between 1895 and 1903, and then she studied at the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, 1903-1908, graduating with the degrees of M.B. and Ch.B. from Edinburgh University, 1908. Her aunt, Dr. Isabella Mears, a missionary in China, was one of the first ten women to become a doctor in Britain. From 1908, and for a year, Bartholomew worked as an Assistant in General Practice, and then in 1909 she gained a post as a Medical Missionary in the Womens Hospital, Nagpur, India where she carried out surgical work and midwifery. In 1914, she returned to Scotland, and on the outbreak of war took over her brother's medical practice near Edinburgh. In 1915 however, in November, she had returned to India, and in Bombay married Frank Rushworth who was at that time a Captain in the 7th Rajputs, an Indian Regiment stationed in the North West Frontier. By the end of the year though, Rushforth had been sent to Mesopotamia. In 1916, Winifred was working in the Mission Hospital, Jalna, in central India, doing surgical work and inoculations against bubonic plague and cholera. In 1917, her husband returned to India to a government post in Simla, and she did surgical work in a womens hospital there. In 1920 they moved to Calcutta, where Frank worked in business and Winifred was a volunteer worker organising infant welfare work and started child guidance with mothers groups. For this work, Rushforth received the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal (Emperor of India Medal). In 1929, in London, she underwent training at the Tavistock Clinic beginning a personal analysis and carrying out analytic treatment of patients. By 1931, the Depression had ended her husband's career in Calcutta and so the family settled in Edinburgh where he worked as Registrar at the Edinburgh College of Art. Rushforth continued with personal analysis and in 1933 began work as an analytical psycho-therapist in private practice in Edinburgh - at this time, very much pioneer work in Scotland. In 1939, just as the War started, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was joined by Dr. Elspeth Macleod - a child therapist - and several of her own patients who had teaching and other qualifications, and opened a small clinic with the support of a Presbyterian congregation. This was the Davidson Clinic. Her confidence in analytic psycho-therapy was strengthened by the arrival in Scotland of Jewish refugee psychiatrists from Germany, and one of them, Dr. William Kraemer, joined her in 1941 and they worked together for sixteen years establishing the Davidson Clinic. During the wartime years, and after, the Clinic flourished, and as other doctors and clinicians associated themselves with it, psycho-therapists were able to be trained. As far as patients were concerned - and as concerned the analytical work - at one time as many as 100 patients were being treated daily. Then, with the passing of the Mental Health Act (1959), and the re-organisation of the mental hospitals across the UK, the treatment of neurosis and psycho-therapy was taken over by the State and new era of treatment began using barbiturate drugs and tranquillisers. Unable to offer comparable salaries to those offered by the National Health Service (NHS) it became impossible to recruit psychiatric staff, and so the Davidson Clinic was not able to survive. From its inception in 1939 and until 1965, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was the Honorary Medical Director of the Davidson Clinic. On the death of her successor, she returned to the Clinic to wind up its affairs. Then, in 1967, Rushforth was awarded the OBE in recognition for her work. From 1965 until her death she continued her private practice in psycho-therapy working both with individual patients and also with Dream-Growth groups. In addition, Easter and Summer schools were held after 1965 and out of these the Sempervivum Trust emerged. Rushforth also provided inspiration to the work of the Salisbury Centre, Edinburgh (1973), and of Wellspring, Edinburgh (1978). In 1981, at the age of ninety-five, she published Something is happening: spiritual awareness and depth psychology in the new age. It was first published in London by the Turnstone Press. Another work was Ten decades of happenings (1984), which was an autobiography. After her death, Life's Currency: Time, Money and Energy: An Anthology of Shorter Writings (1986) was published. Dr. Winifred Rushforth died at her home in Edinburgh on 29 August 1983. Sir Laurens van der Post attended Dr Rushforth's Memorial Service in Old St Paul's Church, Edinburgh, as Prince Charles's representative. Earlier that year, the Prince and Princess of Wales had visited her in her home.

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

John Baillie served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1943-1944. The Church and Nation Committee was set up in 1919, by the Church of Scotland, to review its relationship to the national life of the country. It set up the more specific Commission for the Interpretation of God's Will in the Present Crisis at the General Assembly of 1940. Its role was, 'to seek reverently to guide the Church in the interpretation of the Holy Will and Purpose of God in present-day events, and to examine how the testimony of the Church to the Gospel may become more effective in our own land, overseas and in the international order'.

The 'Donaldson report' was a report from an expert group established by the government and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson. The group was asked to undertake an assessment of the anticipated benefits of new areas of research using human embryos, the risks and alternatives, and ultimately, to advise whether these new areas of research should be permitted. The report, 'Stem Cell Research: medical progress with responsibility', was published by the Department of Health in June 2000. The report concluded that research was warranted across a range of sources of stem cells, and that it did not raise any new ethical issues different from those already raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research. The report was followed by a response from the government in August 2000, which accepted all the report's recommendations and undertook to introduce regulations to extend the permitted research purposes under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and to set out unequivocally in legislation the existing ban on reproductive cloning.

Geoffrey McKay Gibbon was born in Scarborough on 16 July 1896. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and obtained the degrees of M.B., Ch.B. in 1920. He was registered in Scotland on 8 July 1920. In the 1920s he was living in Elgin and Forres in Scotland, but in the early 1930s he was in Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire, England. It was at this point in his career that when requested by the Registrar of the General Medical Council (Scottish Branch) for notification of any changes to his qualifications, Gibbon's wife informed the Registrar that in September 1931 her husband 'was appointed Surgeon to the R.R.S. 'Discovery II' ' and that he would be absent from the UK for 2-years. The Royal Research Ship 'Discovery II', which had been built in 1929, had sailed from London with Gibbon on board on 3 October 1931 on its second Antarctic commission. The purpose of the expedition was research into the economic resources of the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies in the southern ocean, and more particularly into the most important of these resources at the time: the whale populations and the whaling industry of the waters of the latter, and beyond. The ship had been under the command of Lieut. A. L. Nelson R.N.R. and Comdr. W. M. Carey R.N. (retired), and surveyed from the Magellan Strait to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and then in the oceans around South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. By 1934 Gibbon was working for the Cyprus Medical Service, and in the 1940s he was with the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda. In 1954, the Medical register indicated that he was residing in the Port Elizabeth area of South Africa. Latterly, in the early-1960s (1962), Gibbon lived in Lympstone, Devon. His name ceased to appear in the Medical register after 1983.

John Smith Flett was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, on 26 June 1869. He was educated at Kirkwall Burgh School and at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. In 1886 he entered Edinburgh University studying Arts, Science, and Medicine, and was awarded the degree of M.A. at the age of nineteen, the degree of B.Sc. in 1892, and the degrees of M.B. and C.M. (Master in Surgery) in 1894. A brief spell in medical practice followed, before he joined the staff of the Geology Department of Edinburgh University as Assistant to Professor James Geikie (1839-1915), and then as a Lecturer in Petrology. Flett's earliest noteworthy research was his investigations into the stratigraphy of the Old Red Sandstone of Orkney and into the petrography of the alkaline dykes found in that formation. For this Orkney research he was awarded the degree of D.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1900, and that year too he became Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1901, Flett took up the post of Petrographer to the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and acquired a comprehensive knowledge of British rocks. Whilst in post, he collaborated with Dr. Tempest Anderson (1846-1913) in studying the vulcanicity of the Soufriere and Mont Pelee in the West Indies. In 1911 he became Assistant to the Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and during the First World War he was responsible for the supply of geological information required. In 1918, Flett was appointed OBE and was awarded the KBE in 1925. Towards the end of his career, Flett was responsible for the transfer of the Geological Survey to the Geological Museum at South Kensington, in 1935. His published works include a collaborative piece,James Geikie: the man and the geologist(1917) as well asThe first hundred years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1835-1935(1937).

The prolific writer, editor and compiler Josiah Conder was born in Aldersgate, London, on 17 September 1789, the son of a map engraver and bookseller, Thomas Conder. At the age of ten his first essay was published in The Monthly Preceptor, and on reaching thirteen, he began work as an assistant in the family's City bookshop. In 1811, at the age of twenty-one, he took it over. Shortly afterwards, Josiah married Joan Elizabeth Thomas (Eliza Thomas). He had initially formed a literary association with her in 1810 to jointly contribute to the book The associate minstrels. Josiah Conder was a close friend of the engraver and educationalist Isaac Taylor (1759-1829) and his wife, and Conder addressed poems to them both, having been a regular visitor to their home. Another of Conder's earlier works was The withered oak (1806), otherwise The reverie (1811), The star in the east (1824), A dictionary of geography (1834), The epistle to the Hebrews, a new translation, with notes (1834), The congregational hymnbook (1834), The literary history of the New testament (1845) and The harmony of history with prophecy, an explanation of the Apocalypse (1849) are among the publications of which he was author, editor or compiler. Josiah Conder's political work included a tract on the superior value of free labour over slave labour, Wages or the Whip (1833). Josiah Conder died on 27 December 1855, at St John's Wood, Hampstead, following an attack of jaundice, and was buried at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington. His literary wife Joan, died aged 91 in 1877 and was buried with him.

In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.

George Chalmers was born in Fochabers, in Moray, in 1742, and was educated in Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He studied Law at Edinburgh University. At the age of twenty-one he travelled with his uncle to America, to Maryland, and he practised law in Baltimore. On the outbreak of the American Civil War he returned to Britain, settling in London in 1775 where he began writing chiefly on political and colonial matters. In 1786 he was appointed to the Board of Trade as 'chief clerk of the committee of privy council for trade and foreign plantations'. He then turned to writing biography, publishing on Daniel Defoe, Thomas Paine and Thomas Ruddiman (Scottish grammarian and printer). In the 1800s he turned to the poetry and history of Scotland publishing poems of Allan Ramsay and Sir David Lyndsay. His works included: Annals of the present United Colonies (1780), Three tracts on Ireland (1785), Life of Daniel De Foe (1786), The poems of Allan Ramsay, with a Life of the author (1800), Caledonia starting in 1807, and Life of Mary Queen of Scots, drawn from the State Papers, with six subsidiary memoirs (1818).

Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt. They were married in 1914 just after he had been appointed headmaster of the Burgh (now known as the Grammar) School in Kirkwall. During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. His published works include The Orkney Norn (1929), and posthumously Orkney Farm-Names (1952).  Dr Hugh Marwick died in Kirkwall on 21 May 1965.

In 1812, Napoleon had invaded Russia with the aim of forcing Tsar Alexander I to remain in the Continental System and to remove a threatened Russian invasion of Poland. His Grand Army crossed the River Niemen in June 1812 and the Battle of Borodino followed in September 1812 ending in a tactical defeat for the Russians and the opening of the road to Moscow for Napoleon. By 14 September, Moscow had been captured but the Russians had largely abandoned the city. The Tsar refused to capitulate and the city Governor ordered the burning of Moscow. Without a clear victory, Napoleon began the retreat from Moscow and a return to Paris. In the Moscow Campaign, Napoleon had lost 380,000 men and another 100,000 had been captured, and seeing an opportunity, Prussia, Sweden, Austria and a number of German States re-entered the war. Major battles in Germany in 1813 included Luetzen and Bautzen in May 1813, Dresden in August 1813, and the Battle of Leipzig (the Battle of the Nations) in October 1813. Napoleon would subsequently lose the French Campaign in 1814, and go into exile on Elba briefly before being defeated finally at Waterloo in 1815. The description of events near Sottrum, North Germany - between Ottersberg and Rotenburg, just to the southwest of Hamburg - which is the focus of the material of this collection, can be read in the context of events in Germany at the time, and just prior to the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The description appears to have been written 50 years after the event and tells of the rout of between six thousand and eight thousand French troops by a handful of Hamburg volunteers and cossacks.

James Campbell was born at Carsphairn (Dumfries and Galloway), on 16 July 1789, to William Campbell (1755-1829) and his wife Agnes (nee Riggs) (1760-1838). He studied for the ministry at Glasgow University (matriculated 1806) and was licensed by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright on 7 May 1817. He spent time as tutor to the Hart family of Castlemilk, and travelled to France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with them (around 1814). He was with them during their flight from France when Napoleon returned to power. On his return to Scotland he searched for a suitable parish, and became tutor to the family of Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie in Traquair parish. He was ordained as Minister of Traquair (Church of St. Bride) in September 1820, having been presented by George, Prince Regent, in January 1820. Campbell spent his whole ministerial career in Traquair. On 26 October 1820 James Campbell married Mary Combe (d. 1860), daughter of Matthew Combe, a Leith brewer. One of their daughters, Agnes Mary Campbell, married Jardine Wallace (1834-1910) who succeeded James Campbell as Minister at Traquair. James Campbell died on 29 April 1861, aged 71.

For the Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd., Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades from 1921. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times.  The 'Empress of Britain' of the 1950 and 1960s was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain', the 25,526 ton ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II at Govan on 22 June 1955. The ship was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963.  Verna Isaac, of Wichita, Kansas, sailed on the 'Empress of Britain' (Tourist Class) on Tuesday 22 August 1961 westbound across the Atlantic from Liverpool to Montreal where it arrived on 29 August. The sailing was via Greenock and Quebec.

John Webster Lowson Spence was born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) in 1871, the son of a Church of Scotland missionary, the Rev David Brown Spence, who later moved to Constantinople. The younger Spence went to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating in 1898. After an earlier association with Wilhelm Roentgen (discoverer of X-rays, 1895), radiology became his speciality, first as an assistant in the new electrical department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then, from 1907, as head of the electrical and radiological department of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children where he remained for 22 years. Because of the lack of protection available in these early years of working with X-rays - and indeed lack of understanding of the damage that they could do - Spence soon showed signs of illness and damage and between 1910 and 1916 he had to undergo amputations. In 1922 he was awarded a bronze medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund with an annuity of £130 in recognition of his work in radiology. A few years after his death his name was inscribed on a memorial erected in the garden of St. George's Hospital in Hamburg (April 1936) by the German Roentgen Society to honour those X-ray pioneers who had sacrificed their health or their lives in the interests of their work. John Webster Lowson Spence died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1930, aged only 58.

John Archibald Watt Dollar, born in 1866, was a member of the equine veterinary practice T. A. Dollar and Sons, Veterinary Surgeons, New Bond Street, London. His father, the founder of the practice, was Thomas Aitken Dollar (1833-1909). The elder Dollar studied at the then Edinburgh Veterinary College and was awarded the Highland and Agricultural Society's certificate in 1851. In 1880, he was Vice-President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. By the time Dollar died on 26 September 1909, the veterinary practice was the largest in London with a presence (veterinary forges) in Baker Street, in Westminster, in Blackfriars, in Lambeth, in Belgrave Square, in Chelsea, and in Paddington. The practice also had paddocks at Wells House Farm, East Acton During the 1880s, John Archibald Watt Dollar and his older brother William Watt Dollar (1860-1938) joined their father's veterinary business, though the younger Dollar spent much of his time travelling abroad and visiting veterinary colleges. John was credited with introducing the first equine operating table to Britain - the table had been designed by himself. He published too and his works include: a translation ofMoeller's operative veterinary surgery(1894), then with Albert Wheatley and othersA handbook of horse-shoeing with introductory chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot(1898), then with Gustave Moussu,Diseases of cattle, sheep, goats and swine(1905), and with Heinrich Moeller, theRegional Veterinary Surgery and Operative Technique (incorporating Prof. Dr. H. Moeller's 'Veterinary Surgery'.)(1912), andDollar's Veterinary surgery : general, operative, and regionalwhich went to a 4th edition in 1950. John A. W. Dollar was Warden of the Worshipful Company of Farriers from 1900 to 1903, and was President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, circa 1904-1905. On the death of their father in 1909, the two brothers continued to work together at the practice which moved to Baker Street in 1919. They retired in 1926 however, and the practice was sold to a Mr. Tay. John Archibald Watt Dollar died in 1947.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959.

The Dutch marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger was born in 1633 and baptised in Leiden, Holland, in the Dutch Republic. He was a son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, also a marine painter. The younger van de Velde, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute, and had achieved great celebrity in his art before he came to London. In 1673 he moved to England, where he was engaged by Charles II, at a salary of £100, to aid his father in 'taking and making draughts of sea-fights'. His part of the work was to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder van de Velde. He was also patronised by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility. Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. Willem van de Velde the Younger died on 6 April 1707 in London, England and was buried at St. James's Church. The MP John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor, was born on 8 November 1790.

Duncan Forbes was born on 10 November 1685, the second son of Duncan Forbes of Culloden and Bunchrew, near Inverness. He went to Edinburgh University to study law, but in 1705 proceeded to Leiden instead to study civil law and oriental languages, returning to Scotland in 1707. He was admitted as an advocate in 1709, and was also appointed Sheriff of Midlothian around the same time. During the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, his brother John Forbes (who had joined with Simon Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat) accompanied him to Inverness where they raised forces in support of the government. Duncan was rewarded with the office of Depute-Advocate which he took up in 1716. In 1721-22, Forbes was MP for Ayr, and in 1722 he was returned in Inverness. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Advocate in succession to Robert Dundas of Arniston. As the English system of taxation was extended into Scotland troubles began to arise and rioting took place in Glasgow in 1725. Forbes accompanied a force commanded by General Wade, and the Glasgow magistrates were arrested for their negligence and brought to Edinburgh with some of the rioters. They were later freed. Edinburgh too suffered trouble within the brewing industry at this time. In 1735, Forbes succeeded to the family estates on the death of his brother. In 1737 he opposed the Bill bringing penalties on the City of Edinburgh after the Porteous Riots. In the wake of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, he protested against the cruelties of the Duke of Cumberland. Duncan Forbes died on 10 December 1747.

History of Art (formerly the Department of Fine Art) is a popular and long-established department of Edinburgh University. It has the oldest full-time Chair of Art History in Britain which was founded in 1880. History of Art is located at Minto House, 20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, opposite the Royal Museum of Scotland, and within easy walking distance of most of the galleries and museums of central Edinburgh. History of Art has book, slide and photographic collections, as well as a photographic unit. There is also a laboratory for the demonstration of metalworking techniques and methods of conservation. A collection of postcards in photo albums and small file drawers was gathered together by members of Fine Art staff (in the Department's early years) for use as teaching aids before the advent of the popular colour slide format. The early postcard collection is important in that the cards are primarily of European buildings, many of which were lost or damaged during the revolutions and conflicts of the 20th century.

Walter Ledermann was born on 18 Mar 1911, the second of William and Charlotte Ledermann's four children, in Berlin, Germany. His Father was a physician, though the family was accustomed to poverty following World War I and the depression of the 1920s. Ledermann was a promising student from an early age, and a keen violinist. He received his leaving certificate from the Leibniz Gymnasium early due to his performance in classics and mathematics, which allowed him to complete his degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Berlin. There he encountered several mathematicians and physicists of note who inspired him, including Issai Schur, Heinz Hopf, Max Plank, and Erwin Shrodinger.  On completion of his degree, it became clear to Ledermann that he could no longer stay in Germany. He won a scholarship created by students at St Andrews to support a Jewish refugee, during which time his brother was working in Edinburgh to gain a medical qualification. Ledermann was awarded his PhD after two years.  Encouraged by Professor Turnbull of St Andrews University, Ledermann sought an interview with Professor Edmund Whittaker (later Sir) at the University of Edinburgh with a view to seeking employment there. Whittaker invited him to come as a visiting student to Edinburgh for one term, offering him a bursary of £50 and encouraging him to attend the lectures of A C Aitken. Aitken quickly became a friend to Ledermann, and introduced him to Godfrey Thomson, Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and Director of Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). At that time, Thomson required a mathematical assistant for a Carnegie funded project which would eventually result in the publication of his seminal book, The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and he immediately offered Ledermann the post. It is from this period that the majority of Ledermann's papers, which largely comprise of letters from Thomson, were created. Ledermann's work with Thomson was interrupted for 6 months in 1937 when Ledermann accepted a post teaching at the University of Dundee. He returned to work with Thomson in Edinburgh until 1938, when he took a lecturer's post in the University of St Andrews. In 1940, Ledermann's naturalization was completed, and he was also awarded his DSc from the University of Edinburgh. He married his wife, Ruth Ledermann, a social worker, in 1946, later having a son, Jonathon. The couple moved to Manchester, where Ledermann was worked as a lecturer in pure mathematics in the University of Manchester, from 1946-1962.  In 1962 Ledermann gained a lecture post at the new University of Sussex, where he eventually became a professor. He found the atmosphere of the modern university highly stimulating, and taught for two further years past the statutory age of retirement (then 65). Even after his official retirement in 1978, Ledermann continued to give occasional courses and revision classes to his students until 1997, when he and Ruth, by then a psychotherapist, moved to London. Ledermann died in London on 22 May 2009.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

The lecture explores how schools could, and should, benefit the whole community by giving pupils a happy, clean environment which serves as a model for what the home should be, and by giving them the knowledge and skills in order to work towards solving practical and social problems in their communities.  He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

Three copies of manuscript letters from Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) to Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji are dated 25 May 1926 from Montrose, 5 January 1932 from London, and 19 August 1955 from Lanarkshire. The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

At E2010.24 there is an autograph letter signed from Marwick to Professor Bruce Dickins, placed and dated as Alton (Kirkwall), 26 January 1965. The letter was written around 3-4 months before his death and is autobiographical. The content is largely reminiscenses about his time at Edinburgh University. He writes, 'There are now so few of my old-time friends surviving that I feel very lonely [and] to hear from any of them is a rare pleasure. Do you know – of my friends of my Univ. days I don't know of any one left!' He goes on to tell about his lodgings in Edinburgh and how he shared with three Orcadians: R.C. Wallace (later Principal of Queen's University, Ontario); J.A. Gunn (later Director of the Nuffield Institute of Medical Research, Oxford); and, Gunn's younger brother J.W.C. Gunn (later Professor of Pharmacology at Cape Town). Apparently the lodgings 'all found were 16 shillings a week'. The small collection also includes some note and letter fragments, and offprints of three articles by Marwick: 'The 'Old Man' in Place-Names', Saga och Sed, (1959); 'An Old Celtic Loan-word in Orkney Place-Names', Namn och Bygd, Vol. 48 (1960); and, review of F.T.

Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.

The collection is composed of three bound volumes being Sir John Fraser's journal of a tour made around the world in 1935. Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates.

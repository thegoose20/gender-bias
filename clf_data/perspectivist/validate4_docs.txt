James Geikie (1839-1915) was the leading British authority on Pleistocene geology, developing the theory that during ice-ages mild inter-glacial periods interrupted the glacial period as a whole. He originated the current belief that human habitation continued in Europe throughout the glacial period. Geikie undertook classes at the University of Edinburgh while working in a printer's office. In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924) whom he succeeded as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh.

Christabel Harriette Pankhurst was born in Manchester on 22 September 1880. She was the daughter of lawyer Dr. Richard Pankhurst and women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and sister of Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela Pankhurst. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War. Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst, DBE, died on 13 February 1958.

The Scottish Widows Fund and Equitable Assurance Society, or Scottish Widows, was established in 1815 in Edinburgh. The idea for the setting up of a fund for the financial protection of the relatives of deceased clergyman and schoolmasters had been put forward by a group of prominent Scotsmen in March 1812. The fund would protect 'widows, sisters and other females' from poverty, and would be achieved by insuring capital sums on lives. The plan was extend the benefits of the fund to all parts of Britain. By September 1821, funds had reached £20,000, and in 1845 they stood at £1,700,000. In our own modern times Scottish Widows became part of Lloyds TSB Group.

Writer and reviewer John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, 6 August 1889. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and Brasenose College, Oxford. His literary career began in 1911 and his last book was publishe din 1957. Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired an autobiography of the great novelist. In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. John Middleton Murry died 12 March 1957.  In the 1930s a dispute had arisen between John Middleton Murry and Catherine Carswell (1879-1946). She had attempted to answer Murry's work on D. H. Lawrence through a work of her own but publishers Chatto & Windus had withdrawn her book because of threats of legal action from Murry. Martin Secker had reissued a revised version in 1932. The letter here refers to this dispute.

Hamish Henderson was Scotland's leading folklorist, as well as a major poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist. He was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. His mother was Janet Jobson Henderson (d. 1933), a cook and housekeeper who had served as a nurse on the western front, and his father was James Scott (1874–1934), an army officer. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian, Jacobite maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. He also spent time in Dundee, Somerset, and Devon. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. In the world of the 1930s, the Depression, the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, and Scottish nationalism at home, would each shape Henderson's worldview and political outlook. When war broke out in September 1939, Henderson attempted to enlist in the Cameron Highlanders but he was rejected because of weak eyesight. He was called up the following year, joining the pioneer corps. However, with a gift for languages, he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer in January 1942, and served in north Africa with the Eighth Army. His service in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily.  During 1947 and 1948 he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. And, over and over again, Henderson's writings displayed a keen and deep appreciation of internationalism, foreign literature, and people's culture. Throughout his life too, he corresponded privately connecting with many of the finest minds of the day, and also wrote through the columns of national newspapers. Towards the end of the 1950s, on 15 May 1959, Henderson married Renate Felicitas (Kätzel) Schmidt (b. 1937) in Coburg, Germany Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene too. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002.

The collection is composed of: 1 x letter from Professor George Chrystal to the Rt. Hon. The Prime Minister [Herbert Henry Asquith, 1908-1916] from 5 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, 12 June 1911. The letter, in effect turns down the honour of a knighthood 'on the occasion of His Majesty's approaching Coronation'. He was, in the first place, 'at this moment suffering from the effects of severe illness' and it would be several months before he could 'appear in London or take part in any public ceremonial', and in the second place, as a 60-year old widower with a family 'the greater part of which is still dependent' on him, he was 'therefore in no condition to support the social distinction of knighthood'. 9 x photographs of Chrystal and members of his family, being:    
      1 x photograph of William Chrystal, Professor Chrystal's father
      1 x portrait photograph, mounted on card, of the wife of Professor Chrystal

The body of the letter is probably in the hand of a secretary, although the signature itself is thought to be that of Adam Ferguson. The letter dated 16 November 1815, St. Andrews, was written only 3-months or so before his death. The letter is to 'Dear Sir' and bears the address, James Chalmer Esq.r. / Abingdon Street / Westminster / London The letter refers to how on 'the other leaf of this paper' there is 'the original of a letter' which will explain itself. 'How a claim of mine founded upon it has originated is not material'. All he means 'is hereby to empower' James Chalmer 'to receive the contents in my behalf if any such be forthcoming'. He has 'requested the Bankers at Edinburgh to concur in giving' Chalmer 'the same power'. He has no doubt that Coutts (presumably the banking house of Coutts) 'upon the sight of this paper will also concur'. What Ferguson wanted was that 'whatever money should be so obtained may be laid out in the purchase of an Annuity' for his son, Adam Ferguson, 'and in any Fund either publick or private is properly secured for his life'.  The letter does not include 'the other leaf'.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter
from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278.  Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Any

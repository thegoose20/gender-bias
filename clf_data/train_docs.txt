Robert G. Edwards studied in Beatty's research group in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics and received his PhD in 1955. The correspondence here, however, covers the period when Edwards was based in Cambridge as a Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology and, in collaboration with Patrick Steptoe, was conducting work on fertilising human eggs in a laboratory. This work on in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which in 1978 would lead to the birth of the first 'test-tube baby', gained Edwards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010, but at the time led to much hostility, opposition and legal controversy.

The Centre for Reproductive Biology stemmed from a proposal made to the University in October 1970 by David T. Baird, Beatty and Anne McLaren in association with Richard V. Short. They argued for the establishment of a multidisciplinary centre for reproductive biology in Edinburgh, in recognition of the increasing role of reproductive biology in medical, agricultural and social problems. Additional impetus was provided when the Medical Research Council invited medical schools throughout Britain to compete for the establishment of a new Unit of Reproductive Biology. The Centre was to incorporate the existing MRC Unit of Reproductive Biology and the independent University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The Centre was housed in a newly constructed building on a site made available by the Regional Hospital Board at the Royal Infirmary, partially with a grant of Â£266,000 from the Ford Foundation. The delay in the building's completion meant that Beatty was close to retiring by the time of its opening, so in 1977 he withdrew from the Centre. The Centre was commissioned in July 1979 and was officially opened a year later by Simone Veil.

The Main Library building of Edinburgh University Library was opened on George Square, Edinburgh in 1967. The new building was designed by J. Hardie Glover and Andrew Merrylees of the Sir Basil Spence partnership Spence, Glover & Ferguson (Edinburgh). Planning started in 1963 and construction began in March 1965. The building featured external materials such as Portland stone, concrete and glass, and interior finishes included teak, white beech, glazing, carpet tiling, and quartzite flooring. Furnishings in the building included Danish chairs in black plywood and stainless steel. When the new Library building was completed in September 1967, Edinburgh University Library began the move of some 2-million books from its old location, Playfair Library in the Old Quad' (designed by Robert Adam). Although the Main Library building has provided excellent space through its 40 year history, by the 2000s it was struggling to provide the facilities and working spaces required for 21st century methods of teaching, learning and research. In addition, four decades of wear and tear on the building meant that it was in need of a comprehensive upgrade. The University has invested 60 million in refurbishing the building to make it fir for new purpose. The article in the 1968 magazine piece featured in this collection was Jim Burgess, and the photographer was Henk Snoek (1915-1980). Snoek was said to be 'one of Britain's most accomplished architectural photographers', and worked for architects as diverse as Basil Spence and Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall. He was born in the Netherlands, and he studied at the Hague School of Art. Snoek's photography reflected the Bauhaus principles on which the Hague School of Art was run, and was 'characterised by a strong sense of drama, simple, forceful lines and high contrasts'.

For the Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd., Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades from 1921. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times.  The 'Empress of Britain' of the 1950 and 1960s was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain', the 25,526 ton ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II at Govan on 22 June 1955. The ship was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963.  Verna Isaac, of Wichita, Kansas, sailed on the 'Empress of Britain' (Tourist Class) on Tuesday 22 August 1961 westbound across the Atlantic from Liverpool to Montreal where it arrived on 29 August. The sailing was via Greenock and Quebec.

The name David de Hasteville, in London, first appears in theCalendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I. 1640-41., p.377, in the 'Petition of David de Hasteville, formerly called Father Archange de Hasteville, AbbÃ© du Val de Sainte Croix and General of the Order of St. Romuald to [Sec. Windebank]'. De Hasteville had recently become a Protestant and was seeking 'some sort of entertainment or pension'. He had also petitioned the House of Commons in 1648, describing himself as a Protestant who had recently left his native France and 'a plentiful estate'. Apparently in 1643 he had been appointed general of artillery under Sir William Waller, and had raised three hundred and fourteen men at his own cost, not receiving any government cash, and was then in danger of arrest for money owed for the billetting of his soldiers.

Beale gained MRC funding in 1966 to embark on a programme conducting genetic analyses of malaria parasites. Walliker was suggested to Beale as a collaborator by Professor P.C.C. Garnham at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who had supervised Garnham's PhD on fish parasites. By early 1970, the first genetic cross had been successfully conducted in a rodent malaria parasite, which demonstrated the Mendelian nature of genetic inheritance of malaria parasites. Walliker took over the direction of this project after Beale's retirement and became the leading figure in the Edinburgh malaria genetics programme. In 1986, Walliker was made an honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

The Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland, now subsumed by the Institute of Governance, was acknowledged as the leading centre in the country for studies of Scottish society and politics. At the centre of the Unit's work was the study of policy-making and the political process in Scotland, set in a broad comparative and international context. Constitutional change in Scotland had been one of the Unit's central themes since its founding in the mid-1970s for which it drew on diverse disciplines, notably in Law and Social Sciences. It conducted The Scottish Election Study, which provided an in-depth account of how and why Scotland voted at the 1997 General Election, especially in the context of long-term changes in electoral attitudes and behaviour. A similar study had focused on the Scottish Referendum in September 1997. The Unit was followed by the Governance of Scotland Forum in 1998, and then by the Institute of Governance in 2002 A number of publications had emanated from the Unit throughout the 1980s and 1990s on a variety of issues, including pieces on the re-organisation of Scottish local government, management of councils, financing Scottish home rule, gender and Scottish society, labour market policy in Britain, citizenship, Scottish churches and the political process, women in Scottish politics, data protection and privacy, and democratic participation in the Scottish Parliament.

He is famous for studies on the relationship of mental illness to brain injury and for the development of public health policies in relation to mental health. He was also a celebrated author and orator. he was knighted in 1886. Crichton-Browne was born in Edinburgh on 29 November 1840. His parents were William Alexander Francis Browne (1805â1885) and Magdalene Howden Balfour, daughter of Dr Andrew Balfour of Edinburgh.

He studied English Literature at Edinburgh University from 1929, graduating in 1933 with a First. MacLean then began a teaching career, starting in Portree after qualifying from Moray House (teacher training college). Briefly between 1937-1938 he taught at Tobermoray Secondary School before returning to Edinburgh in 1939 to the English Department of Boroughmuir High School. In 1940, MacLean joined the Signals Corps and was posted to North Africa. He was seriously wounded at El Alamein in November 1942, and was invalided home to Scotland. He returned to his teaching post at Boroughmuir in 1943. In 1946 he married Renee Cameron. Although their life seemed settled in Edinburgh, and Sorley had been drawn into the literary circle of Douglas Young and his associates, which included George Campbell Hay, Norman McCaig, and especially Robert Garioch (Alastair Sutherland), he accepted the appointment of Headmaster at Plockton High School in 1956. MacLean's output included Seventeen Poems for Six-pence (with Garioch, 1940), Dain do Eimhir (1943), and co-authorship of Four Points of a Saltire (1970). He retired as Headmaster at Plockton in 1972 but then found himself drawn into a new educational experience, first as the Creative Writing Fellow at Edinburgh University (1973-5) and then as Filidh ('Poet') at the then embryonic Gaelic College at Sabhal Mor Ostaig (1975-6). Sorley MacLean died in Inverness on 24 November 1996.

The Ferretti family of Ancona, on the Adriatic, came from Germany in the 14th century. They were men-at-arms. The family enriched themselves in the 17th century during the Wars of Religion in France. The Ferretti family sired military engineers, marine soldiers - Ancona being a base against the Turks - papal diplomatists, a Saint, and a Pope (Pius IX) whose Pontificate from 1846 to 1878 has been the longest in 2000 years. Today, a branch of the Ferretti's of Ancona build powerful leisure craft. The Marche National Archaeological Museum is situated in Ancona's fifteenth century Palazzo Ferretti. This archive of the Ferretti Family begins in 1574 with the last will and testament of the richest man in Ancona at the time 'Il Perillustrissimo Conte Angelo', and closes in the mid-18th century with an impressive marriage and the tale of the family coach.

The letter is said to be a forgery of a letter from Robert Burns to Edinburgh engraver James Johnson by forger Alexander Howland 'Antique' Smith. Smith was responsible for forgeries of letters not only by Robert Burns but by Sir Walter Scott and Mary Stuart and many prominent historical figures. He had earned the nickname 'Antique' Smith from his interest in old documents and ephemera. Smith appeared in the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh, on 26 June 1893 charged with selling and pawning spurious manuscripts as genuine, obtaining money by pretending that certain documents were genuine and not what they purported to be, and by offering false stories as to the origin of documents and manuscripts when knowing them to be false. The circulation of forgeries came to light the previous November in an article in theEdinburgh Evening Dispatch. Facsimiles of the forgers notes had been included in the article and a reader recognised the handwriting as that of a copying clerk working in various Edinburgh law offices - the clerk was 'Antique' Smith. Smith's explanation was that while in employment with the firm of Thomas Henry Ferrier WS as chief clerk he had been asked to get rid of a huge quantity of old documents that had accumulated in the cellars of the law office. On examining these he had found that many of the documents were of value and so he had begun selling them to booksellers, auction rooms and pawnbrokers. When the original stock ran out he had then provided fakes to replace them, and he claimed that he was able to supply any type of document required. Smith - the one and only mass-producer of literary forgeries in Scottish history - was found guilty on all charges but leniency was recommended. He was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

In 1812, Napoleon had invaded Russia with the aim of forcing Tsar Alexander I to remain in the Continental System and to remove a threatened Russian invasion of Poland. His Grand Army crossed the River Niemen in June 1812 and the Battle of Borodino followed in September 1812 ending in a tactical defeat for the Russians and the opening of the road to Moscow for Napoleon. By 14 September, Moscow had been captured but the Russians had largely abandoned the city. The Tsar refused to capitulate and the city Governor ordered the burning of Moscow. Without a clear victory, Napoleon began the retreat from Moscow and a return to Paris. In the Moscow Campaign, Napoleon had lost 380,000 men and another 100,000 had been captured, and seeing an opportunity, Prussia, Sweden, Austria and a number of German States re-entered the war. Major battles in Germany in 1813 included Luetzen and Bautzen in May 1813, Dresden in August 1813, and the Battle of Leipzig (the Battle of the Nations) in October 1813. Napoleon would subsequently lose the French Campaign in 1814, and go into exile on Elba briefly before being defeated finally at Waterloo in 1815. The description of events near Sottrum, North Germany - between Ottersberg and Rotenburg, just to the southwest of Hamburg - which is the focus of the material of this collection, can be read in the context of events in Germany at the time, and just prior to the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The description appears to have been written 50 years after the event and tells of the rout of between six thousand and eight thousand French troops by a handful of Hamburg volunteers and cossacks.

Bruce Henderson Kenrick, clergyman and housing campaigner, was born 18 January 1920 in Aintree, Liverpool, the son of an accountant. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School in Crosby. During the Second World War he served with the Army Medical Corps in West Africa - in the Gold Coast, now Ghana - and then with the Eighth Army and the Parachute Brigade in Italy. After the war he began studies in Medicine at Edinburgh University but during his studies he became involved with the Christian Union which led to his switching courses to Theology. He was awarded the degree of B.D. on 9 July 1954. Also in 1954, Kenrick married Isabel Witte, a Bostonian. After his ordination as a Presbyterian minister in 1961 - the Church of Scotland - he continued his studies at Princeton Theological Seminary and joined the ecumenical ministry of the East Harlem Protestant Parish (EHPP) which was involved in promoting a Christian response to rising racial tensions. Between 1956 and 1959, Kenrick served as a missionary in Bengal - in Calcutta - where he and his wife supported local movements for land reform. However, when he contracted typhoid in India they returned to the UK. The family then moved to Iona in the west of Scotland where he had become a member of the Iona Community - an ecumenical community created by the Rev. George MacLeod in 1938. Between 1962 and 1980 the Kenricks were in Notting Hill, London, where he worked with an ecumenical group ministry modelled on the EHPP. In 1963, while in Notting Hill, he established the Notting Hill Housing Trust after becoming appalled at the housing conditions in the area Kenrick's work in Notting Hill inspired him to found the housing charity Shelter which was launched in 1966 as a national campaigning body for housing. The charity was given a huge boost by the public outcry after the BBC screening of the Ken Loach film Cathy come home. Kenrick was then able to persuade the Labour government of Harold Wilson to introduce legislation to provide funding for housing associations to enable them to buy and renovate run-down properties, and also for a rent rebate scheme for poorer tenants. In 1980, Kenrick was appointed as a minister in the United Reformed Church in Bayswater. Later still, he moved to another ministry in Hackney before retiring to Iona where he often served as a locum minister. Prior to that, in 1983, he became divorced from his wife. Kenrick's publication record includes The new humanity (1956), Come out the wilderness (1962) which was his account of his experience with the EHPP, and which carried a foreword written by the Rev. Trevor Huddleston, and A man from the interior (1980) which was written after a visit to Cuba and in which he argued that Communism and Christianity could co-exist. The Rev. Bruce Henderson Kenrick died 15 January 2007 in Oban, aged 86.

Lewis T. Waters from Maryland, USA, studied and researched at Edinburgh University in the 1960s. He was awarded the degree of Ph.D (Edinburgh) in 1970 for his thesis entitled Urban form systems in physical planning: a case study of Cumbernauld. During the course of his research, and with relevance to a portion of his thesis, he found some correspondence between Sir Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) and Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) particularly interesting. The material had been passed to him by Arthur Geddes, the younger son of Sir Patrick Geddes. Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater, Aberdeenshire on 2 October 1854. He was educated at Perth Academy and then studied at the Royal College of Mines in London, 1874-1878. He lectured in Zoology at Edinburgh University, 1880-1888. He held the Chair of Botany at University College, Dundee, from 1888 to 1919, and the Chair of Sociology at the University of Bombay from 1919 to 1924. Geddes was actively occupied in city improvement, town planning, and educational initiatives at home, on the continent, and in India. He drew up a city plan for both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and he developed the Cite Universitaire Mediterraneanne (College des Ecossais) at Montpellier, France, and the educational facility at the Outlook Tower, Edinburgh.  Geddes was knighted in 1932. His publications included: Evolution of sex, with Sir J. Arthur Thomson; Cities in evolution; and The life and work of Sir Jagadis C. Bose. Sir Patrick Geddes died in France, at Montpellier, on 17 April 1932. Geddes was an influence on several British urban planners, notably Raymond Unwin. Raymond Unwin was born on 2 November 1863. He was the younger son of William Unwin of Balliol College, Oxford. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and then he trained in engineering and architecture, and practised as an architect from 1896. He laid out schemes such as: New Earswick, York; Letchworth; and, Hampstead Garden Suburb. From 1911 to 1914 he was a special Lecturer in Town Planning at Birmingham University. In 1914 he became Chief Town Planning Inspector, Local Government Board, and during the War he was Director of the Housing Branch, Ministry of Munitions. After the War, he was Chief Architect, Housing, at the Ministry of Health, and he served on several Departmental Committees dealing with housing and town planning matters. He was Chief Advisor to Greater London Regional Town Planning Committee, 1929-1933. Unwin was knighted in 1932. His publications included: The art of building a home, with Barry Parker; Town planning in practice; and Nothing gained by overcrowding. Sir Raymond Unwin died in June 1940.

Royalties earned from Moray House Test sales were transferred into a research fund established by Thomson with the aim of supporting educational research. The fund was later registered as the Godfrey Thomson Research fund. The trust was formally established in 1940, when a Deed of Trust was drawn up between Thomson and the University. The fund was later administered by trustees, with the Professor of Education as Chairman and the Principal of Moray House College of Education as Vice-Chairman.  Additionally, the fund earned income from fees paid by county Education Committees for the analysing, collating and assessing of Moray House Test results.

Robert Persons, also known as Robert Parsons, was born on 24 June 1546 at Nether Stowey, Somerset. He studied at St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, in 1562, and on completion of these he became a fellow and tutor at Balliol College in 1568. However, because of his strong Catholic leanings, he was forced to resign in 1574. Persons left England in 1575 and entered the Jesuit Order in Rome returning with Edmund Campion (1540-1581) in 1580. He narrowly escaped again after Campion's arrest and martyrdom. In 1596, in Seville, he wrote Memorial for the Reformation of England, which provided insight into the kind of society England was to become after its return to the Catholic faith. Father Robert Persons died in Rome on 15 April 1610.

William McLaren (1923â1987) was born in Ferniegair, Hamilton, but grew up in Cardenden, Fife, Scotland with a crippling handicap that affected his feet. He attended Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, before going to college in Edinburgh. In 1944 he earned his Diploma and the Highly Commended Post Diploma from Edinburgh College of Art. After graduation and with a bursary from the Andrew Grant Fund he left Scotland and visited Italy and France. Throughout his life he remained a francophile and was fluent in French. McLaren earned a living as a commercial illustrator working for such titles as The Radio Times and The Listener. He is noted for illustrating the popular Beverley Nichols gardening books. He also painted murals at Wemyss Castle, St Adrian's Church in West Wemyss, Hopetoun House, Hawthornden Castle and Tyninghame House. He also produced a portfolio of work around Edmund Spenser's Prothalamion.  Edmund Spenser (c. 1552 â 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene (1590-1596), an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognised as one of the premier craftsmen of Modern English verse in its infancy, and one of the greatest poets in the English language. Following The Faerie Queene Spenser released Prothalamion, a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke.

A number of changes had been observed in ruminant offspring following the transfer to recipients of embryos subjected to a variety of treatments, including in vitro culture. The first of these changes to be noted was an increase in size at birth, which sometimes prejudiced the survival of both mother and offspring. This phenomenon became known as 'Large Offspring Syndrome', which was first described in 1991 after the production of calves by nuclear transfer by Steen Willasden. The aim of these research projects was to establish culture systems which support the development of cattle embryos reliably and at high frequency, without causing Large Offspring Syndrome; to identify potential genetic markers in the pre-implantation embryo which might predict an oversize foetus, and to study embryo development and different culture systems. Research was carried out with sheep and cattle by Roslin Institute in collaboration with the Scottish Agricultural College and the Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen. The project 'Manifestation of increased foetal size at birth' was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and 'Factors affecting foetal size in ruminants' was funded by the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department.

David Brewster was born in Jedburgh on 11 December 1781, and was attending Edinburgh University classes at the age of twelve in 1793. It was his ambition to go into the Church. Indeed, Brewster gave his first sermon in March 1804 but nervousness led him to abandon this career. That year he became tutor to a family in Dumfriesshire and he remained there until 1807 while he pursued scientific studies and the study of literature.  In 1807, Brewster was a candidate for the Chair of Mathematics at St. Andrews University, but without success. In 1813, he submitted a paper to the Royal Society of London on Some properties of light and the same year he published a Treatise on new philosophical instruments. In 1814, illness prompted him to visit Paris and Geneva and on his return to Britain he continued publishing. In 1815, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1816, Brewster invented the kaleidoscope and although he patented the invention, it was quickly pirated because of a fault in the registration. He published his Treatise on the kaleidoscope in 1819.  Together with the mineralogist Professor Robert Jameson, he edited the Edinburgh philosophical journal, previously called the Edinburgh magazine, and in 1819 when the name changed again to the Edinburgh journal of science he was the sole editor. In 1820, Brewster became a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and in 1821 he was active in the formation of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts of which he became director. In 1822, he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In December 1837, he became the Principal of the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard at St. Andrews University. In 1859 he became Principal of Edinburgh University. Sir David Brewster died from an attack of pneumonia at Allerly, Melrose, on 10 February 1868.

She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War. Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst, DBE, died on 13 February 1958.

In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.

His work has a distinctly Orcadian character and he is considered one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century. Brown had a long association with publishers Chatto and Windus. This had begun in 1959 when they published, under its Hogarth Press imprint, his second volume of poetry Loaves and Fishes. He remained with Chatto and Windus until 1984. It had been Hugo Brunner (Chatto and Windus) who first suggested that someone should write the story of his life, and the writer proposed was Maggie Fergusson. The job was done with Fergusson's The Life of George Mackay Brown published in 2006 by John Murray. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996. Hugo Brunner (Sir Hugo Lawrence Joseph Brunner) was born on 17 August 1935. His parents were Sir Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897-1982) and Dorothea Elizabeth, daughter of the Victorian era actor manager Henry Irving (1838-1905).

William Saunders was born in Banff in 1743 and was a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School, studying under Cullen, and became a key figure in the history of medicine in the late-18th century. After graduation with the degree of MD - thesis De Antimonio in 1765 he moved to London to work for Sir George Baker (1722-1809) focussing at first on chemical investigations into 'Devonshire Colic'. He would reveal that the condition was caused by the presence of lead in the cider manufacturing process. In 1770 Baker recommended the appointment of Saunders to lecture at the newly formed medical school at Guy's, London. There he delivered the institution's first programme of lectures on the theory and practice of medicine. He remained at Guy's until 1802, and in 1807 he became physician to the Prince Regent. William Saunders retired from practice in 1814, and he died on 29 May 1817 at Enfield.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt.

During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938.

Hamish Henderson was Scotland's leading folklorist, as well as a major poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist. He was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. His mother was Janet Jobson Henderson (d. 1933), a cook and housekeeper who had served as a nurse on the western front, and his father was James Scott (1874â1934), an army officer. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian, Jacobite maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. He also spent time in Dundee, Somerset, and Devon. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. In the world of the 1930s, the Depression, the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, and Scottish nationalism at home, would each shape Henderson's worldview and political outlook. When war broke out in September 1939, Henderson attempted to enlist in the Cameron Highlanders but he was rejected because of weak eyesight. He was called up the following year, joining the pioneer corps. However, with a gift for languages, he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer in January 1942, and served in north Africa with the Eighth Army. His service in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily.  During 1947 and 1948 he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. And, over and over again, Henderson's writings displayed a keen and deep appreciation of internationalism, foreign literature, and people's culture. Throughout his life too, he corresponded privately connecting with many of the finest minds of the day, and also wrote through the columns of national newspapers. Towards the end of the 1950s, on 15 May 1959, Henderson married Renate Felicitas (KÃ¤tzel) Schmidt (b. 1937) in Coburg, Germany Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene too. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002.

Albert E. G. Pilliner was born in Glasgow in 1909 but spent much of his childhood in Shrewsbury, where his father worked as an engineer. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury. Although he was accepted by Cambridge University, he was unsuccessful in receiving a scholarship and so went to Birmingham University where he studied Chemistry. On graduating, Pilliner went into teaching. During the Second World War, he was selected for work in a government research facility near Wrexham and there he used his statistical knowledge and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of explosives. It was at this period in his life that Pilliner met William Emmett, another statistician. After the war, he took up teaching again, teaching Chemistry and Physics, and continued to keep in touch with Emmett. It was possibly through this communication that Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson came to hear of Pilliner, because in 1949 he took up a post as lecturer at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). On Thomson's retiral in 1951 and subsequent death in 1955, Pilliner and his colleagues continued Thomson's work within what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment, University of Edinburgh - dubbed Room 70 during Thomson's time. Pilliner took over the running of Room 70 as well as lecturing to the Dip.Ed. and B.Ed. courses for a number of years. In 1961, after a successful research trip to Israel on behalf of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Pilliner was invited to work for the NFER (National Foundation of Educational Research) which he turned down. By the 1970s however, most of his time was spent working as a consultant to the British Council, UNESCO, and other bodies, and he conducted research into the examination systems of many countries including Mauritius, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Albert E. G. Pilliner died in 2003.

They were married at St. George's Chapel, Windsor on 10 March 1863. Before the death of his mother and his own accession to the throne, Edward held the title of Prince of Wales. No-one since Edward has been heir apparent to the throne for a longer period. During his reign, now called the Edwardian period, the office of the Prime Minister saw its first official recognition. Edward VII was the first British monarch to visit Russia. This happened in 1908. He had also assisted in modernising the British Home Fleet. His interest in seafaring and the Navy earned him the name of 'Sailor King'. Edward VII reigned from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May 1910.

This collection item is often described as a death-mask. It is not a death-mask, rather it is a life-mask made from a mould taken from the living face of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The a German writer, pictorial artist, biologist, theoretical physicist, and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt-am-Main, Hessen, Germany. His work spanned the fields of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, and science. Goethe was one of the key figures of German literature and the movement of Weimar Classicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His influential ideas on plant and animal morphology and homology were extended and developed by 19th century naturalists including Charles Darwin. In politics Goethe was conservative and he served as a Privy Councillor of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar. Goethe's influence spread across Europe, and for the next century his works were a major source of inspiration in music, drama, poetry and philosophy. Goethe's works included: Faust which has been called the greatest long poem of modern European literature; Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and The Sorrows of Young Werther. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe died in Weimar on 22 March 1832. Carl Gottlieb Weisser (also Gottlob Weiser) was born in Berlin on 21 August 1779. He took a life-mask of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe possibly on 13 October 1807 for the phrenologist F. J. Gall, who visited Goethe at Weimar. Carl Gottlieb Weisser died in Weimar on 2 April 1815.

Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit was born in 1585. He was the brother-in-law of William Drummond of Hawthornden, the poet. Scott was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, entering it around 1600. He then studied abroad before returning to Scotland having been called to the Bar. In 1611 he acquired Tarvet and other land in Fife to which he gave the name Scotstarvet. In 1617 he was knighted by King James VI and was made a Privy Councillor.Sir John married three times. His first wife was Anne Drummond, the sister of Drummond of Hawthornden, his second was Elizabeth Melville, and his third Margaret Monpenny.Scott was an important supporter and patron of Scottish learning. He endowed the Chair of Humanity at St. Andrew's in 1620 and was responsible for advancing two major patriotic publication projects - theDelitiae poetarum Scotorum(1637) and the Scottish maps forBlaeu's Atlas Novus(1654). In honour of James VI he published a Latin poemHodoeporicon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scotia sua discessum.His late seventeenth century workThe Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmenwas a reflection on the instability of success, including his own fall from office after years of service to king and country.In 1637, when Charles I insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland, and brought bishops into government, it incited revolution in the form of the National Covenant which was signed at Greyfriar's Kirk, Edinburgh, in 1638, by nobles, ministers and thousands of ordinary Scots. That same year, at the parish church in Ceres, Fife, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet subscribed to the Covenant too. The Covenant demanded a free Scottish Parliament and a free General Assembly - free from the monarch's interference. In 1640, he served on the committee of the Estates for the defence of the country (the Estates was the then Scottish Parliament). During the ensuing war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649.Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit had been a Privy Councillor both to James VI and to King Charles I, and a Lord of Session, and Lord of Exchequer (Scotland). However, during Cromwell's Commonwealth he lost his positions of high office. These would not be given back to him after the Restoration either. He died at Scotstarvet in 1670.In the 18th century the estate of Scotstarvet was bought by Wemyss of Wemyss Hall (Wemyss Hall, near Cupar, Fife).

The Scottish judge, Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, was born around 1605 and was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall, first baronet. He studied for the legal profession, became an advocate, and was knighted in 1632. In 1640 he was placed on the Committee of Estates appointed to provide for the defence of the country against King Charles I (the Committee of Estates had been appointed to govern Scotland when Parliament was not in session). In 1651, his brother Sir Alexander Hope was examined by the Committee of Estates for advising the King to surrender Scotland and Ireland to Cromwell, during which he quoted Sir John, Lord Craighall, as having stated that the King should 'treat with Cromwell for one-half of his coat before he lost the whole'. In 1652, Sir John was appointed as one of three Scottish judges who, together with five English judges, comprised Cromwell's committee responsible for the administration of justice. Another brother, Sir James Hope (1614-1661), was a representative for Scotland in the English Parliament in 1653. Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, died in Edinburgh on 28 April 1654. It had been Sir John Hope and Sir James Hope who in the 1660s had owned the lead-ore company at Leadhills in the Lowther Hills - an area along with Wanlockhead which yielded other ores too. Indeed gold was discovered in the area during the reign of James IV, when gold-mining had provided employment for 300 persons. Although gold-mining declined, the export of lead-ore from Leadhills was very important in the early modern Scottish economy, and the Hope family had built on their control of this industry to acquire property and land. The lead mines were profitable enough to justify building or improving roads the full 50 miles to Leith from which the ore could be exported to the Low Countries for smelting.

David John Wauchope Dundas was born on 3 February 1886. He was one of two sons of Colin Mackenzie Dundas, Commander R.N., of Ochtertyre, Stirlingshire (1842-1902) and Agnes, second daughter of the late Samuel Wauchope, Esq., C.B. In the 1900s, Dundas studied at Edinburgh University and these studies included lectures on Agriculture and Entemology given by William Fream (1854-1906) who in 1890 had become the first Steven lecturer at Edinburgh on agricultural entomology, and also by Professor Robert Wallace (1853-1939) who - like Fream - had previously been on the staff of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. On 14 February 1920, Dundas married Winifred Hersey MacKenzie, the youngest daughter of Colin James MacKenzie WS., JP., of Portmore.

The science writer and philosopher Thomas Dick was born in Hilltown, Dundee, on 24 November 1774. He was the son of a handloom weaver. He was inspired towards science on seeing a bright meteor in 1783. In 1794 he entered Edinburgh University supporting himself by private tutoring, but he did not proceed to taking the MA degree because of the additional fees.

The Lords of the Congregation were a group of Protestant Scottish nobles who in the mid-16th century favoured reformation of the church along Protestant principles and a Scottish-English alliance. They had opposed the marriage of the young Queen Mary - daughter of James V and Mary of Guise - to the Dauphin of France (who became King Francis II of France from 1559 to 1560) and signed the 'First Band' or Covenant to work to make Scotland Protestant.  Following religious riots in Perth, the Lords gained support and provided military help to John Knox in opposing the troops of Mary of Guise. Near Cupar, in Fife, the Lords were strong enough to face-off a French and Scottish army jointly led by the Duke of Chatelherault, who as Regent had supported the French match, and D'Oysel the French king's lieutenant. By July 1559 the Lords of the Congregation had taken Edinburgh. As Edinburgh Castle was held against them, the Lords withdrew under the terms of the truce of the Articles of Leith.  In September, Chatelherault, now joined by his son the Earl of Arran, changed sides and became leader of the Congregation Lords. Mary of Guise, who had earlier offered a degree of religious tolerance, maintained that their motives were secular in part. Queen Mary and King Francis wrote to her in November 1559, declaring that the lords were acting maliciously under the name and cloak of religion. French re-inforcements pushed the Lords and their Protestant army back to Stirling and Fife. By the Treaty of Berwick in February 1560, the Lords brought in an English army to resist the French troops. The armed conflict now centered on the Siege of Leith. After the death of the Queen Regent in June and the conclusion of hosilities at Leith by the Treaty of Edinburgh in July, the Scottish Reformation was effected - through the Scots Confession of Faith - in the Parliament of Scotland in August 1560. After events reported in the document described here, the Congregation suffered a series of setbacks, with Mary of Guise retaking Edinburgh. However the arrival of English troops by sea in January 1560 sealed the course of reformation in Scotland. The Reformation Parliament which was convened in Edinburgh 10 July 1560 would appoint John Knox and others to draw up the Scots Confession of Faith. Thomas Henderson referred to in the document was a burgess of Jedburgh at this time, and Sir John Forster (c.1515-1602) was an English administrator in the Scottish borders, deputy warden of the English middle march.

James Geikie (1839-1915) was the leading British authority on Pleistocene geology, developing the theory that during ice-ages mild inter-glacial periods interrupted the glacial period as a whole. He originated the current belief that human habitation continued in Europe throughout the glacial period. Geikie undertook classes at the University of Edinburgh while working in a printer's office. In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924) whom he succeeded as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh.

This project aimed to make significant improvements in technologies for the multiplication of bovine embryos by combining methods for in vitro maturation of oocytes and in vitro culture of embryos with existing nuclear transfer technology. The second main objective was to develop embryonic stem cells from cattle embryos by culture techniques and to investigate opportunities for using the nuclei of such cells for transplantation, and the generation of embryos on an extensive scale. Funding was provided by the Milk Marketing Board, the Meat and Livestock Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry. The work was carried out jointly by the Cambridge and Edinburgh Research Stations of the AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research, and was based within Animal Biotechnology Cambridge Ltd. The scientific director was E.J.C. Polge.

Writer and reviewer John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, 6 August 1889. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and Brasenose College, Oxford. His literary career began in 1911 and his last book was publishe din 1957. Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired an autobiography of the great novelist. In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. John Middleton Murry died 12 March 1957.  In the 1930s a dispute had arisen between John Middleton Murry and Catherine Carswell (1879-1946). She had attempted to answer Murry's work on D. H. Lawrence through a work of her own but publishers Chatto & Windus had withdrawn her book because of threats of legal action from Murry. Martin Secker had reissued a revised version in 1932. The letter here refers to this dispute.

William Fraser was born in the Mearns, Kincardineshire, on 18 February 1816. After private education in Stonehaven, in 1830 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the firm of Messrs., Brand and Burnett, solicitors in the town. In 1835 he went to Edinburgh where he joined the firm of Hill and Tod, WS, and continued his education at Edinburgh University , studying Scots' Law and conveyancing. He also took classes in French.  Many of the legal cases in which he became involved had required antiquarian and, in particular, genealogical research, and he was therefore introduced at an early stage to those studies in which he later on would became an expert. He steadily built up a great body of knowledge which made possible his great series of fifty or so volumes on the histories of between twenty and thirty of the leading noble and landed families of Scotland - the Stirlings of Keir, 1858; the Montgomeries, 1859; the Maxwells of Pollok, 1863; the Carnegies, 1867; Grandtully, 1868; Colquhoun, 1869; Carlaverock, 1873; Lennox, 1874; Cromartie, 1876; Scotts of Buccleuch, 1878; Menteith, 1880; Grant, 1883; Douglas, 1885; Wemyss, 1888; Haddington, 1889; Melvilles, 1890; Sutherland, 1892; and Annandale, 1894. Fraser was Keeper of her Majesty Queen Victoria's Records in Scotland, from 1852-1894. In 1882 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1885 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath and in 1887 he was made a Civil Knight Commander of the Bath, being invested by Queen Victoria at Osborne House on 2 August 1887.

In a letter to the Ford Foundation on 20 January 1977, Beatty gave his reasons for deciding to withdraw from the Centre: 'It has recently become apparent that the projected completion date for the Reproductive Biology Building will be late 1979 or early 1980. I retire in April 1980 and it no longer makes sense for me to think of moving into the new building. It would be more realistic for me to withdraw now and make way for the finding of some alternative group to occupy the accommodation earmarked for me.'

The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829. He renewed his contact with the composer later in Berlin and elsewhere on the continent, also making the acquaintance of Schumann.

This collection is composed simply of an invitation - dated 6 August 1907 - from the elders, managers and members of the congregation to the Rev. William Dobbie to take up the post of Pastor at Castle Hill United Free Church in Forres, Moray, Scotland. William Dobbie was born on 21 May 1881 in Ayr. He attended Ayr Academy and studied at Glasgow University. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Ayr in May 1906, and assisted at Glasgow Camphill until 1907 when he was ordained and inducted at Castle Hill U. F. Church in Forres, 20 September 1907. Dobbie married Jean Fulton Hamilton on 25 April 1911. In 1914 he translated to Glasgow Govanhill and then did war service with the YMCA in France in 1916. In 1921 he translated to Lanark Cairns. The Rev. William Dobbie died on 30 April 1946. For the origins of Castlehill U. F. Church, we have to look at events of 1733 when the First (or original) Secession saw members leave the Church of Scotland as a protest against the system of Patronage, by which a minister was appointed to a congregation on presentation by a landowner. A congregation was founded in 1768, when a group in Forres joined the Secession Movement. The first church was built at the north end of Batchen Street, Forres. It had various names over time: United Secession; United Presbyterian; and, United Free. The foundation stone of the Castlehill Church was laid on September 22, 1870, and it was opened and dedicated on November 26, 1871, with building costs of Â£3,000. In 1900, the United Presbyterian and the Free Churches united to form the United Free Church of Scotland. This meant that there were two U.F. Churches in Forres, and each had to take a distinctive name. It was at that point that it was named Castlehill, from the site on which it stood, and the other became the High Church. In 1902 the Town Council presented the freedom of the burgh to Lord Strathcona in Castlehill Church. In 1903 James MacDougall Black became the minister and remained until 1907. Dr Black was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1938-1939. Two outbreaks of dry-rot, in 1902 and in 1946, meant that extensive and expensive work was necessary, and this was paid for by the congregation and by generous donations from Lord and Lady Strathcona and Andrew Carnegie. When the Rev. David Leslie Scott, Minister of Forres Castlehill Church, retired on 30 June 1972 the church was closed and the charge united with Forres High Church under the name of Forres St Leonard's. The former Castlehill Church was sold to the Forres Parish Church of St. Laurence and became its church halls. After a protracted period of refurbishment, it was eventually opened and dedicated on September 5, 1976. Dry-rot however can never be eradicated completely and some thirty years after the last repair the rot had reached such as state that it became beyond the economic means of the congregation of the Parish Church of St. Laurence. The building was finally sold on 30 June 2006, which was 34-years after the building was closed as a church.

These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory.
|
Beale first met the American biologist Tracy Sonneborn in 1947 at a summer symposium at Cold Spring Harbor, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his group at Indiana University, Bloomington, to work on the protozoan group Paramecium. Beale remained in Bloomington for nine months from October 1947, and would pay many subsequent visits, enjoying the congenial atmosphere and Sonneborn's company. Beale's work on Paramecium genetics would continue for many years throughout his career, as would his correspondence with Sonneborn. When Sonneborn died in 1981, Beale wrote his biographical memoir for the Royal Society.

Prior to the foundation of the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education in 1970, governance of postgraduate medical education in Scotland was carried out by regional committees drawn from the Royal Colleges, University medical schools and the National Health Service. Following the Royal Commission on Medical Education report (often called the Todd Report) in 1968, the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education (SCPME) was established in 1970 with the purpose of co-ordinating, funding and advising on postgraduate education and training in hospitals, general practice and clinical psychology in Scotland.  In October 1992 the SCPME was reconstituted as the Scottish Council for Postgraduate and Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), and in 1993 it became a Special Health Board of the NHS. NHS Education for Scotland was established as a Special Health Board by Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 103, The NHS Education for Scotland Order 2002. The staff and functions of SCPMDE, including the South East of Scotland Postgraduate Medical Deanery, transferred to the new body in April 2002, together with those of the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting and the Post Qualification Education Board for NHS Pharmacists in Scotland.

The English composer, music journalist and pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji on 14 August 1892 in Chingford, Essex. He was the son of a Parsi father and a Spanish-Sicilian mother. As a composer Sorabji was self-taught. As a critic Sorabji was connected to the radical weekly New Age magazine which had been taken over by Alfred Richard Orage, and to New English Weekly. His music criticism was notable for its acerbity and wit, and also for championing - at the time - unfashionable composers such as Mahler and Szymanowski. His own works were of great complexity, and he played them in London and Paris in 1921 and in Vienna in 1922. Thereafter he discouraged public performance of his music until relenting in the mid-1970s. He remained something of a cult figure however. His works included the Symphonic High Mass (1955-1961), the massive (four-hour), multi-movement Opus clavicembalisticum (1930), and the Etudes transcendantes (1940-1944).  Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji died at Winfrith Newburgh, near Dorchester, in Dorset on 15 October 1988. He had been a friend of the composer Alistair Hinton, who was the founder of the Sorabji Archive. In 1994 many of his original manuscripts went to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle, Switzerland.

The Scottish painter David Wilkie was born on 18 November 1785 at Cults, Fife. He went to school locally at at Pitlessie, and at Kettle, Fife. While at school he was able to exercise a drawing ability which was obvious at an early age. When he was fourteen, in 1799, he set off to Edinburgh, to the Trustee's Academy of Design in St. James's Square. While there he made progress in painting portraits and miniatures. In 1804 he returned to Cults and there he produced a painting of the Pitlessie Fair which made him very well-known. After a brief stay in Aberdeen, Wilkie sailed for London in May 1805 where he continued his studies. His painting of The Village Politicians brought him more attention and, of course, new commissions. On the death of his father in 1812, his mother and sister came to London to join him, and from 1812 the family lived in Kensington, initially at Lower Philimore Place. Works by Wilkie include: The Reading of the will; The Highland family; Princess Doria washing Pilgrims' feet; Guerilla Council of War; Preaching of Knox before the Lords of the Congregation, 10 June 1559; The Duke of Wellington writing a despatch; and Napoleon and the Pope in Conference at Fontainebleau. David Wilkie was knighted in June 1836. In 1840, he travelled to Istanbul (then called Constantinople) where he painted Abdul Medjid, the young Sultan, and then went on to Jerusalem in 1841. That year he set off home again reaching Alexandria on 26 April 1841, and there he painted Pacha Mehemet Ali. A month later he sailed again, but after departing from Gibraltar on 1 June 1841, he died. On account of the quarantine regulations of the period, Sir David Wilkie was buried at sea at latitude 36 degrees 20' north and 6 degrees 42' west.

Henri V, the legitimist King of France from the abdication of Charles X in 1830 until his death in 1883, went into exile when Louis-Philippe was proclaimed king in August 1830. He established his court at Holyrood in Edinburgh, and a number of publications are associated with his time here. This is a curious collection of anonymous letters, apparently from a member of the refugee court, on a political theme. The provenance is unclear, but there is a loose note stating 'Pour mes pauvres petites filles de France' signed 'Louise' - and hopefully further research will identify her.

In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.

Charles Hedges was born in either 1649 or 1650. he was educated at Magdalen, Oxford, where he took a B.A. in 1670, an M.A. in 1673, and a D.C.L in 1675. In his last year of study he was admitted to the Society of Advocates, and by 1686 he was Chancellor and Vicar-General of the Diocese of Rochester. In 1689 he was created Master of the Faculties and Judge of the Admiralty Court. Hedges was also knighted on 4 June 1689. From 1698 he contested various constituencies for a seat in Parliament including Orford in Suffolk, Dover, Calne and Malmesbury, West Looe, and East Looe. In 1700 he became a Secretary of State and Privy Councillor with the help of the Earl of Rochester (1641-1711). For some time Sir Charles Hedges resided at Richmond Green, but in 1700 he bought an estate in Compton Bassett, near Calne in Wiltshire. Hedges died on 10 June 1714. The background to the collection item, from Hedges as Secretary of State, to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is the Aliens Act of 1705 which stated that, from Christmas Day 1705 until the Scottish Parliament passed an Act settling the Scottish Crown upon the successor to the English Crown, every Scot should be considered an alien. At the time that the letter was written (November 1706) the Viceroy (Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland was James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde KG, KT (1665â1745), Irish statesman and soldier. The Duke of Ormonde had succeeded the Earl of Rochester to the post in 1703, and was Viceroy until 1707.

The Museum of Scotland, part of the National Museums of Scotland, was designed by the architects Benson and Forsyth. The firm had been selected as winners of an archictectural competition in 1991. The design received inspiration from Scotland's national building tradition, evoking the idea of castle, broch, tower house, and tenement. Materials used include external cladding of golden Clashach sandstone from Morayshire, and concrete, limestone, beech, and smooth plaster in the interior of the building. A roof-top garden offers views of Edinburgh Castle , Greyfriars Kirk, the Scott Monument, the city skyline generally, the sea, and the hills. The Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, was the first national museum project in the UK since the mid-19th century and it was opened by the Queen in November 1998. Professor Michael Lynch, Edinburgh University, was appointed as a consultant to the Exhibition Review Committee (ERC) which oversaw the planning of the building and the devising of the content.

At the time of his death in 2006, Professor William T. Baxter CA, was Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the London School of Economics (LSE). He had joined the LSE just after the end of the Second World War following periods spent as a student in the USA (at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard), as a part-time Lecturer at Edinburgh University, and as Professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. While in Edinburgh in the 1930s, Baxter met Kenneth E. Boulding (1910-1993), economist, philosopher, poet and Nobel-nominee. Born in Liverpool, England in 1910, and an Oxford garduate, Boulding had held fellowships at Harvard and Chicago, and after a short spell of teaching at Edinburgh University went to the USA for good and finally settled at the University of Colorado. Boulding's first bookEconomic analysiswas an introductory text book which 'blended Keynesian and neoclassical economic theory into a coherent synthesis'. He believed that 'depressions are due to too little private spending and that governments should run deficits to end them'. Baxter is lauded for his theory of deprival value and its use in nationalised and private utilities in the UK, and for his contribution to the accounting standards debate. Professor William T. Baxter died in 2006 at the age of 99-years, and just short of his 100th birthday. Professor Kenneth E. Boulding died in 1993.

Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, in October 1854. He was the youngest son of Capt. Alexander Geddes, and he grew up in Perth where he was educated at Perth Academy. He then studied under Thomas Henry Huxley at the Royal School of Mines, London, 1874-1878. He also studied at University College, London, at the Sorbonne and at the University of Edinburgh and at Montpellier, France. Geddes succesively demonstrated or lectured in Physiology at University College, London, in Zoology at Edinburgh University from 1880 to 1888, and held the Chair of Botany at University College Dundee from 1888 to 1919. At the University of Bombay, India, he organised a department of sociology and civics and held the Chair of Sociology there from 1919 until 1924. Although trained in Biology, Geddes had generalist interests and these soon led him to become a social geographer, practical administrator, historian, dramatist and philosopher. He involved himself in the renovation movement in the Old Town of Edinburgh and it was in the Old Town too that he situated his famous Outlook Tower, a museum of local, regional, Scottish, and world history. In 1919, Geddes who was 'considered one of the greatest living authorities in civics and social survey' was entrusted by the International Zionist Commission to plan New Jerusalem and its proposed university. He was also the founder - in 1924 - of the College Des Ecossais (Scots College), an international teaching establishment located in Montpellier. In the British Mandated Territory (part of which later became Israel), the new city of Tel Aviv (the White City) was constructed from the early 1930s until the 1950s based on an urban plan by Sir Patrick Geddes - a plan which reflected modern organic planning principles. He was also involved in Indian town planning work. Publications by Patrick Geddes include:Chapters in modern botany,1893;City development : a study of parks, gardens, and culture institutes,1904;Cities in evolution : an introduction to the town planning movement and to the study of civics,1915;Leben und Werk von Sir Jagadis C. Bose,circa 1930; jointly with Sir J. Arthur Thomson,The evolution of sex,1889; and, jointly with Victor Verasis Branford,The coming polity: a study in reconstruction,1917, andOur social inheritance,1919. Geddes was knighted in 1932, and Sir Patrick Geddes died in Montpellier, France on April 17, 1932.

The poet, Tom Scott, was born in Glasgow on 6 June 1918. He was the son of a Clydeside boilermaker. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the family moved from Glasgow to St. Andrews where an uncle of Tom had a stonemason's business. After a brief apprenticeship to a butcher, Tom became an apprentice stonemason. His poetic spirit first manifested itself in his singing voice (described variously as tenor, or bass). During the Second World War, although a pacifist, he contributed to the war effort - believing that fascism had to be fought against - through his service in the Pay Corps. It was at this time he began to write poetry. Scott's earlier work was in English, and after the war, settling in London, his circle included Kathleen Raine, and Dylan Thomas. Visits to Europe encouraged his Scots poetic voice and he translated the 15th century work of the French poet Villon into Scots. Other work includedSea dirge,The ship,The tree,The dity business, andBrand the builder. In 1966 he completed a Ph.D on the work of William Dunbar which appeared as a book, and he editedThe Penguin book of Scottish verse(1970). In 1963, Scott had married Heather Fretwell and they wrote children's books. Their home was in the Portobello district of Edinburgh. In the 1980s, he contracted myeloma, a rare form of leukaemia, but he survived this. Tom Scott died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 7 August 1995.

The Edinburgh University Sailing Club (EUSC) was founded in 1933 as the Edinburgh University Yacht Club. EUSC is one of the largest sports clubs within the University and its dinghy teams are the most successful teams in Scotland. EUSC is located at the Edinburgh University Sports Union, Pleasance, Edinburgh. Club sailing takes place at Linlithgow Loch, West Lothian, for dinghies, and Largs (Clyde) and Port Edgar (Forth) for yachting. The EUSC is a group member of the Linlithgow Loch Sailing Club. In the 1980s and 1990s EUSC meetings were held on Tuesdays in the Pleasance, and in more recent years at the Wash Bar, Mound, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evenings. The EUSC Cameron Trophy sailing event has been held at Firbush - the University's field centre on Loch Tay - and in the Firth of Forth (the 35th Cameron Trophy was hosted by the Royal Forth Yacht Club). The Trophy has traditionally been held over a weekend during Freshers Week at Firbush, or rather during the weekend immediately before the start of the Autumn term. Club records also show that there has been a Sailing Club Regatta held in in May. The Club has held grand social events such as the Edinburgh University Watersports Ball which was often held at the Prestonfield House Hotel, Edinburgh, but was, in November 1989, held at the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, as well as dinner dances, Hallowe'en, Christmas and Burns functions. Some of these still happen, along with beer and skittles and pub quizzes. The above-mentioned Cameron Trophy had been presented by Lord Cameron to the Edinburgh University Sports Union in the early 1970s. Lord Cameron had served with the RNVR in both world wars and in the Second World War had held the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. He was an honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club and was awarded an honorary blue for his interest in Edinburgh University sport. He held a particular interest in sailing and so the Sports Union decided to invite the EUSC to run an annual regatta at which the winner would be presented with the Cameron Trophy which he had presented. Earlier in the Club's history the trophy was called the Lord Cameron Trophy. Lord Cameron died in 1996, aged 96.

Gaetano Donizetti was born in Bergamo on 29 November 1797. Donizetti was given some musical instruction from a priest who was also the musical director at the main church in Bergamo. As a choirboy though, Donizetti did not shine, but the priest recognised in him a nascent musical ability and managed to have him enrolled at the Liceo Filarmonico - the musical school - in Bergamo. He received training in fugue and counterpoint, and it was at the school that he launched his operatic career. After writing some minor work he went to Naples, then Rome and Milan, and wrote some 31 operas in only twelve years. He became internationally known in 1830 with his  Anna Bolena which was premiered in Milan. Donizetti's most famous work was Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). Gaetano Donizetti died insane on 8 April 1848.  Fausta is a two-act opera by Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian libretto was by Domenico Gilardoni, who died while writing it, and the remainder was written by Donizetti. The opera was given its debut on 12 January 1832 at the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, Italy.

Beale first joined the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), in 1935 as a volunteer assistant, after graduating from Imperial College, London. He was shortly offered paid employment by J.B.S. Haldane, who was then part-time head of the genetics group until 1941. Beale later claimed that 'the appointment at John Innes was a marvellous step forward as the Institution was at that time the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain, rivalled only by Crew's Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh.' Beale's studies encompassed Neurospora and Verbena before he was called up for military service in January 1941.

Also in 1923, in December that year, and again in October 1924, in General Elections, he contested for the Unionists in the Western Isles, Scotland, campaigning in Gaelic. In 1924 too, he married Katharine Allison Swan, in Leith. She had also been a graduate of Edinburgh University and she too was reading for the Bar. As far as a political career was concerned, Morrison would not become an MP until 1929 when he won the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, in England, for the Conservatives. He would hold the seat though for some thirty years, until 1959. He became a KC (Kings Council) in 1934, and was appointed recorder of Walsall, Staffordshire, in 1935.

James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842 Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works areA brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second(1838),An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana(1841),Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases, proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century(1846),New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon(1850),The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original editions(1850), andOutlines of a life of Shakespeare(1881). In the course of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O. Halliwell-Phillipps died on 3 January 1889.

This manuscript volume records medical case notes of male and female patients of the Edinburgh physicians James Gregory (1753-1821) and Daniel Rutherford (1749-1819) in November 1793. Members of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh volunteered on a monthly rotation to treat the impoverished sick at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and it seems likely that this is a record of clinical cases from the Infirmary. In 1790 the physician James Gregory had been appointed joint Professor of the Practice of Physic at Edinburgh University, augmenting the ageing William Cullen (1710-1790). On the death of Cullen soon afterwards, Gregory went on to hold the Chair alone for the rest of his life. He attacked the system of rotation of doctors to the Royal Infirmary on the grounds that patients were uncertain as to which physicians would treat them, and permanent medical staff were appointed eventually. The physician Daniel Rutherford was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1791. Rutherford was also considered to be one of the leading chemists of his generation. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians between December 1796 and December 1798.

William Muir was born in Glasgow in 1819. He was educated at Kilmarnock Academy and then at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities. After his university education he gained a post with the East India Company in the North-West Provinces of India. He entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1837 and became Secretary to the Governor of the North-West Provinces at Agra. His work, particularly during the Sepoy Mutiny (when he was in charge of the Intelligence Department) and his experience, influence, and writing on the history of Islam, led to his appointment in 1868 as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces. He had been created Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1867. Between 1874 and 1876 Muir was Financial Minister to the Government of India, and from 1876 to 1885 he was a Member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. On leaving India he joined the Council of India in London but resigned on his appointment as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh University in 1885. During his term of office, the University underwent many changes as a result of the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. Muir resigned in 1903 because of ill health and died at Dean Park House in Edinburgh on 11 July 1905.

The first Veterinary School in Edinburgh was founded by William Dick in 1823. Successful students at the School were presented with certificates from the Highland and Agricultural Society from 1828. In 1856, John Gamgee was appointed to the Veterinary School as an assistant to William Dick. Gamgee left the following year to open his own New Veterinary School in Edinburgh. The New Veterinary School moved to Bayswater, London, in 1865, where it became the Albert Veterinary College. It closed in 1868. A New Veterinary College was opened in Edinburgh by William Williams in 1873, but this too moved - to Liverpool in 1904 where it became the Veterinary School of the University of Liverpool.

Helen Millar Lowe was born in Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, on 10 December 1897. She was the daughter of James Millar Lowe, a coal agent, and Margaret Lowe, who had married locally on 29 June 1892. She attended Berwickshire High School, in Duns.  Lowe worked with the firm of chartered accountants Chiene and Tait in Edinburgh for nine years, going to them first in 1919. After an Act was passed that allowed women to qualify as Chartered Accountants she indentured with Chiene and Tait, went straight through the examinations and was admitted as a Chartered Accountant in 1926. In the lead up to the CA examinations she took some classes in Accounting and Business Method and Mercantile Law at Edinburgh University. She was the third woman in Edinburgh to qualify as a Chartered Accountant, and according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) she was the second female member of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh, and the fourth woman chartered accountant in all of Scotland. While with Chiene and Tait she did practically all their income tax work and did a good deal of work in arranging investments and insurance.  In 1928 she began her own chartered accountancy business, the first woman in Edinburgh who had taken this step seriously. She conducted her business at 28 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and then from November 1930 at 44 Charlotte Square. During her career she instigated many projects in the service of elderly people, especially through the Edinburgh and Leith Old People's Welfare Council for which she was awarded an MBE in 1964. She had a lifelong interest in the medical profession, mounting a successful campaign in 1957 to ensure that the Bruntsfield Hospital for Women and the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital employed only qualified female medical staff. She was treasurer of both hospitals when they were handed to the NHS in 1947 and also maintained roles in other medical organisations such as the South Eastern Association of the Medical Women's Federation of which she was appointed Honorary Auditor in 1978. A second campaign to save the hospitals from closure in the 1980s was unsuccessful Helen Millar Lowe died on 6 November 1997 just five weeks from her 100th birthday. She left a substantial fortune (reported to have been circa Â£7m) which had been built on a portfolio of stocks and shares and a number of local properties.

Edward Gibbon Wakefield was born in London on 20 March 1796, eldest son of Edward Wakefield (1774-1854), philanthropist and statistician, and grandson of merchant Edward Wakefield (1750-1826) and author and philanthropist Priscilla Wakefield (1751-1832). He was the brother of William Hayward Wakefield (1803-1848), and nephew of Daniel Wakefield (1776-1846). Edward Gibbon Wakefield was educated at Westminster School and at Edinburgh's Royal High School. By 1814, he was serving with the British embassy in Turin, and in 1820 with the embassy in Paris. In 1826 however, he was convicted - with his brother William - of tricking a wealthy heiress into marrying him, and both he and his brother were sent to prison for three years. While he was in prison Wakefield studied colonial affairs and prepared material for publication into a work entitledFacts relating to the punishment of death in the metropolis(1831). He put forward a theory of systematic colonisation and enunciated his views inA letter from Sydney(1820), inEngland and America(1833), and inA view of the art of colonisation(1849). He saw a relationship between the social conditions in Britain and the notion of colonial settlement, viewing the latter as a chance for Britons to take their skills overseas under a familiar constitutional tradition and in a recognisable social framework. Land would be sold in small lots at moderate prices, with the funds gathered then being used to support further colonisation, and some self-government would be allowed. In 1834, the South Australian Association was formed with a view to founding a colony on Wakefield's principles. In 1838, Wakefield accompanied Lord Durham, John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham to Canada and influenced the new Governor-General'sReport on the affairs of British North Americawhich proposed uniting the Canadian provinces and granting them full control of their internal affairs. In 1839, he formed the New Zealand Land Company - an amalgamation of an earlier New Zealand Association and a New Zealand Colonization Company - with the aim of settling and guiding the colony of New Zealand. His brother William would control operations in New Zealand, while Wakefield himself would direct the Company from London where he could continue to argue his case with the Colonial Office. In 1849 he founded - with John Robert Godley (1814-1861) - a Church of England settlement at Canterbury in New Zealand. In 1852, Wakefield left England for New Zealand with his son, landing in Port Lyttleton in February 1853. At once, both father and son launched themselves into New Zealand politics, with the elder Wakefield advising the acting-Governor Colonel Robert Henry Wynyard (1802-1864). In 1854 however, he suffered a complete breakdown in his health. Edward Gibbon Wakefield died in Wellington, New Zealand, on 16 May 1862. His only son, Edward Jerningham Wakefield (1820-1879), who had written on New Zealand based on his earlier stay there, as well as politican, had been elected to the House of Representatives in 1854, representing a Canterbury constituency. He had accompanied his father to Canada in 1838, and first went to New Zealand in 1839, returning to England in 1845. With John Robert Godley, he edited his father's correspondence on the foundation of the Canterbury settlement with the titleThe founders of Canterbury(1868).

Lady Thomson's annotations suggest the lecture was initially delivered to the medical faculty following the suggestion of Sir James Learmonth, and was given to the arts and science faculties thereafter.  The lecture was recorded as a demonstration to teachers on 5 rpm discs, which have survived and are housed at Edinburgh University Library Special Collections.

The mineralogist Robert Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774. His early education was received in Leith and then he became the apprentice of a surgeon in Leith, with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at Edinburgh University, studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. By 1793, and influenced by the Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731-1803), he abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's museum. In 1793, he went to London, meeting naturalists and visiting museums to take notes. A visit to the Shetland Islands followed in 1794, to explore the geology, mineralogy, zoology and botany there. This led to the publication of The mineralogy of the Shetland Islands and of Arran, with an appendix containing observations on peat, kelp, and coal (1798). Earlier, in 1796, Jameson read two papers rejecting the vulcanist interpretation of the formation of Earth that had been put forward by Edinburgh geologist James Hutton (1726-1797). Hutton had propounded the theory that the features of the Earth's crust were caused by natural processes over geologic time; the principle of uniformitarianism. Instead, Jameson supported the ideas of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) who had proclaimed the aqueous origin of rocks; that rocks were formed when immense quantities of minerals precipitated out of the waters of the biblical flood.Other visits to the Scottish islands in the north and west, and to Ireland, produced the two volume Mineralogy of the Scottish isles (1800) which was a fuller description of his views. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiburg, Saxony, to study under Werner. He returned to Edinburgh in 1802.  On the death of Walker in 1803, Jameson was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Keeper of the University Museum. Over his fifty year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum, including fossils, birds and insects. Although he had been one of the great exponents of Werner's geological tenets and founded the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808, Jameson afterwards admitted conversion to the views of Hutton. He died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1854. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum (now Royal Museum) in Edinburgh's Chambers Street.

The Canadian Pacific Railway Company entered the ship-owning business in 1884 with three steamers which were built to operate Great Lakes services. In 1887 a service between Vancouver and the Orient was begun with chartered vessels, to be followed in 1891 by the company's own 'Empress' ships - the 'Empress of China', the 'Empress of India' and the 'Empress of Japan'. Then, in 1890, passenger routes were established between Toronto, Montreal and Chicago. Transatlantic passenger services commenced in 1903 when the fleet was augmented by the acquisition of the North Atlantic interests of Elder Dempster & Company. The Company's 'Empress of Britain' (the first of that name) and 'Empress of Ireland' came into service in 1906. The 'Empress of Asia' and the 'Empress of Russia' followed in 1913, the 'Empress of France' in 1919, and the 'Empress of Scotland' in 1921. In 1921 too the title of the operating company became Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd. On the outbreak of war in 1939, Canadian Pacific placed all their ships at the disposal of the government and several were taken over as troopships. For the company, Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, the passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times. The more modern 'Empress of Britain' was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. The first had been renamed the 'Montroyal' in 1924 and was scrapped in 1930, and the second which came into service in 1931 had been requisitioned as a troopship in 1939. This one was bombed, torpedoed and sunk in the North Atlantic in 1940. The newer ship was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and was the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain'. The 25,526 ton ship was launched by the Queen in 1955 and was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963. It was then chartered for cruising and was sold in November 1964 to a Greek company. Renamed the 'Queen Anna Maria' it sailed from Piraeus to New York and later on from Haifa to New York. In 1975 the ship was sold to Carnival Cruise Lines and was renamed 'Carnivale'. Its name changed again in 1993 to the 'Fiesta Marina'. In April 2000 the ship was still in service, this time with the Greek firm Epirotiki Cruises and called the 'Olympic'.

The son of a veterinary surgeon, James Roland Rider was born in Beamish, Durham, in N.E.England, on 13 November 1894. He was educated at St. Bees, Cumbria, and at Newcastle Royal Grammar School. In 1912 he went to Edinburgh to study at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College but in 1914 the outbreak of war interrupted his studies. Rider enlisted in the Scots Greys and he served at Gallipoli. In 1916 he returned to the Dick Vet', and graduated in 1917, becoming a Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. He then re-enlisted, serving as a Captain in the Army Veterinary Corps (AVC) until the end of the Great War. He was awarded the British War and Victory medals.From 1919 he was employed as a vet by Pease and Partners Ltd. owners of several mines in the coalfields of Durham and Teeside. In 1928 he declined the offer of a Lectureship at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, only to suffer a cut in working hours the following year due to the Depression which began in 1929. In 1930 however, Rider began his own private practice in Darlington.In 1932 he published a paper on 'Hypertrophy and diverticulae in the ileum in pit ponies' for the Veterinary Record, British Veterinary Association.James Roland Rider died of pulmonary tuberculosis in Urpeth, Durham, on 19 November 1942.

The Dutch marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger was born in 1633 and baptised in Leiden, Holland, in the Dutch Republic. He was a son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, also a marine painter. The younger van de Velde, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute, and had achieved great celebrity in his art before he came to London. In 1673 he moved to England, where he was engaged by Charles II, at a salary of Â£100, to aid his father in 'taking and making draughts of sea-fights'. His part of the work was to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder van de Velde. He was also patronised by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility. Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. Willem van de Velde the Younger died on 6 April 1707 in London, England and was buried at St. James's Church. The MP John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor, was born on 8 November 1790. He was born the son of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor and Lady Caroline Howard and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1912. In 1827 he became Viscount Emlyn of Emlyn and Earl Cawdor of Castlemartin in the county of Pembroke. In June 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was MP for Carmarthen from 1813 to 1821 and Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire from 1817 to 1860. He died on 7 November 1860 on his family estate at Stackpole, Pembrokeshire. In 1859, prior to his death, the Earl had acquired photographs of van de Velde drawings which were placed into an album. The photographer of the van de Velde drawings is unknown.

Henry Stewart Noel McFarland was born in Perth on 25 December 1924. He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946.  McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning.  Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK.  McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham. He passed away suddenly in 1973, aged 48.

Covenants such as this Confession of Faith and Covenant of the Church of Scotland in 1638, and again in 1643, which committed the individual and the nation to God, resulted in religious struggle. These public petitions presumed a Scottish relationship with God without a king or queen's interference. Although the text did not state it, copies of the documents signed throughout the country provided an excuse to condemn the episcopal system of Church administration.

Born in 1809 in Orkney, and a medical student at Edinburgh University earlier in his life - 1824-1831 - Sir John Spencer Login was a military surgeon in the service of the East India Company. He served with the Horse Artillery of the Indian Army in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries 1838-1841. He served in Lucknow from 1842 to 1848, and campaigned in the Punjab in 1849. During his career, the Maharaja Dalip Singh (1838-1893) had been placed under the guardianship He died in 1863. During Login's career, the Maharaja Dalip Singh (1838-1893) had been placed under his guardianship and they travelled to England for the purpose of presenting the Koh-i-Noor diamond to Queen Victoria. Sir John Spencer Login died in 1863.

The 'Field of Mars' (or Marsovo Polye) is a large park named after Mars - the Roman god of war - and situated in the centre of St. Petersburg, Russia. At the time of the city's founding in the 18th century, the site was called the 'Grand Meadow', and military solemnities in the honour of victory in the Great Northern War against Sweden were held there. Later, it was renamed 'Pleasure Field' (Poteshnoe Polye), and in the 1740s it was turned into a park with paths, lawn and flowers. When Rastrelli was commissioned to build a Summer Palace for Empress Catherine I, the field was again renamed, this time as 'Tsarina's Meadow'. By the end of the 18th century 'Tsarina's Meadow' became a military drilling ground, and monuments to Russian victories were erected there including one to Alexander Suvorov in 1801. It became known as the 'Field of Mars' in 1805.

Civil engineer and engineering contractor Sir John Jackson was born on 4 February 1851 in York. he was educated at Holgate Seminary near York, and in 1866 was apprenticed to William Boyd engineering works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1868 he began studies at Edinburgh University where he excelled in engineering, surveying and political economy. After University he returned to Newcastle where he worked for his brother, William Edwin Jackson.Jackson submitted a tender for Glasgow's Stobcross Docks which was completed in 1879. Earlier, in 1875, he founded his contracting business which would later become Sir John Jackson Ltd., in 1898. He completed Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 and he worked on the foundations of London's Tower Bridge. He had subsidiary companies in Bolivia, Canada, Chile, South Africa and Turkey, and owned a shipping line, the Westminster Shipping Company Ltd. His greatest work was the extension of the Admiralty works at Keyham, Devonport in 1896-1907. He undertook engineering works across the world, including: the naval harbour and graving dock at Simonstown, South Africa; harbour works in Singapore; the construction of a breakwater at Victoria BC; the naval dock at Ferrol, Spain; advice to the Austro-Hungarians on the extension of the Pola arsenal; the building of the Arica to La Paz railway in 1909, crossing the Andes at a height of 14,500 feet; irrigation works in Lebanon; and, irrigation works in Mesopotamia which involved a barrage across the Euphrates at Hindiyyah (Hindieh Barrage).Jackson was knighted in 1895. He was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh University, and in 1894 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1910 to 1918 he represented Devonport in Parliament as an MP for the Unionists. He was also awarded the Chilean Order of Merit and the Spanish Grand Cross of Naval Merit. In 1901 he was elected a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron.Sir John Jackson died on 14 December 1919.

Some of the anonymous pieces are mentioned in Thomson's handwritten bibliographies, but have been omitted from the typed versions. It has been assumed, therefore, that their inclusion has been due to the fact that they refer to or summarize Thomson's work, rather than his having produced them, particularly since Thomson often includes the work of others in his handwritten bibliographies.

The physician George Fordyce was born in Aberdeen in 1736. He graduated from the Medical School of Edinburgh University in 1785, having been a leading student of William Cullen (1710-1790). He then moved to London to attend the anatomical lectures given by John Hunter (1728-1793). In 1759 he travelled to Leiden, studying with Bernhard Albinus. On his return to London, Fordyce began lecturing on chemistry and materia medica, and in 1770 became physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, London. In 1778 he was admitted into the Royal College of Physicians. he also played a leading role in the preparation of a new and updated version of the Pharmacopoeia Londinensis. George Fordyce died in 1802.

Charlotte Auerbach first met Hermann Joseph Muller when he arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1938. He was to remain at the Institute before 1940 before returning to the United States. His presence at the Institute had a profound influence on many workers there at that time, particularly Auerbach, who said 'Never have I met anybody who combined such penetrating analytical powers with such a breadth and depth of scientific imagination; nor anybody who combined such an absolute rejection of any type of supernatural belief with such a passionate and visonary belief in the perfectability of the human species and of the geneticists' responsibility to work towards this end.'

Information on this volume has been largely based on the research of D. W. Taylor of the University of Otago. Key phrases identified by him are all present in the volume and pinpoint the lectures to 1774-1775.

These files seem to relate to research which Beale was conducting with Piero Luporini relating to the unusual properties of inducing mating of Euplotes minuta strain '1A' in other species of Euplotes. The study was attempting to 'further characterise the purified E. minuta pheromone and study its binding to the different cell types, in order to understand the basis of this unusual case of interspecific cell recognition and mating induction.'

Frederick Sleigh Roberts was the second son of General Sir Abraham Roberts, G.C.B. (1784-1873). He was born at Kanpur (then Cawnpore), India, on the 30 September 1832. Roberts was educated at Eton, Sandhurst and Addiscombe, and he obtained a commission in the Bengal Artillery on 12 December 1851. In the following year he was posted to a field battery at Peshawar, where he also acted as aide-de-camp to his father, who commanded the Peshawar division. Roberts was an outstanding combat leader in the Second Afghan War (1878-80) and the South African War (1899-1902). He became Commander-in-Chief in India (1885-1893), and was the last Commander-in-Chief of the British Army (1901-04) before the office was abolished. He had been made a Field-Marshal in 1895. Foreseeing World War I, he was one of the earliest advocates of compulsory military service. Roberts had first distinguished himself during the suppression of the Indian Mutiny (1857-58). On September 1, 1880, he scored the decisive victory of the Second Afghan War, defeating Ayub Khan's Afghan Army near Kandahar. In the South African War, he ended a succession of British defeats, and captured Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State Republic on 13 March 1900. He then annexed the state as the Orange River Colony in May 1900, and took the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria. He gave way to Horatio Herbert Kitchener as Commander-in-Chief in South Africa in November 1900. Roberts was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in December 1858 for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj, India. He was created a Baron in 1892 and an Earl and Viscount in 1901. Field-Marshal The Rt Hon. The Earl Roberts VC KG KP GCB OM GCSI GCIE PC died from pneumonia at Saint-Omer, France, on 14 November 1914. The Field-Marshal was one of only two non-Royal persons to lie-in-state in Westminster Hall during the 20th century (the other was Sir Winston Churchill). He was given a State Funeral.

Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760.

The Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) which was the forerunner of the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW) was founded on 15 October 1868 at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh. The following year, Sophia Jex-Blake won the right for women to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius who, with others, was able to use combined influence to win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the Association were being printed in the University Calendar thus forging the link between the University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes, and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved, the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By 1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s.

In 1935 Leon Trotsky was invited by Edinburgh University students to become a candidate in the Rectorial election that year. Trotsky had been a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and was second only to Lenin in the early stage of Soviet communist rule. However, he lost out to Stalin in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death. It was Viscount Allenby of Megiddo who went on to become the Edinburgh University Rector in 1935, though he died very suddenly in London the following year from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm - on 14 May 1936. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson then stepped up us Rector. Just a year after the invitation from Edinburgh students, in 1936, Trotsky settled in Mexico. But, on 20 August 1940, acting on the orders of Stalin, Ramon Mercader attacked Trotsky with an ice pick and he died the next day.

The second edition of Holinshed's history of Britain was the edition used by William Shakespeare as the principal source for his histories and also for Macbeth.  The printing history of this work is of particular interest. In February 1587, the printers were ordered by the Privy Council and the Archbishop of Canterbury to delete nine passages that contained objectionable accounts of recent history - three in volume II (Scotland), six in volume III (England). The Privy Council censored text, but of course the printers had to cancel whole leaves, 82 leaves in all. Most surviving copies of the work were duly 'castrated' to order, and cancels (only twelve of them) were inserted to bridge the gaps. In the eighteenth century the original text was reprinted three times from an 'uncastrated' copy or copies, and after 1722 or 1723 these reprinted leaves were generally used to complete later-bound collectors' sets in facsimile. As an interesting aside, some original leaves could escape the Privy Council knife, as in one instance in this Edinburgh University Library copy, where in volume III, there are untouched leaves relating to a report of English support for the Duke of AlenÃ§on's departure in 1582 to assume sovereignty of Zeeland. This was an unhappy episode which was to mark a failure in Elizabeth's policy in the Low Countries. The cancel is said to reduce the report from 362 lines to 12. This Edinburgh copy also includes 4 of the original 1587 cancel leaves inserted loose alongside their 18th century facsimile replacements (representing, in volume II, pp. 421, 424, 438, 431, 443, 444, 445 and 450).

The mathematician, statistician, writer, composer and musician, Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He was of Scottish descent. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912. On winning a university scholarship in 1912 he went on to study at the University of Otago in 1913, enrolling in Mathematics, French and Latin. Studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry. Aitken saw action in Gallipoli and Egypt, and he was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. After his hospitalisation, he returned to New Zealand in 1917. On the completion of his studies in 1920, Aitken became a school-teacher at Otago Boys' High School and the same year he married Winifred Betts the first lecturer in Botany at the University of Otago where he also did some tutoring. Then, encouraged by a professor of mathematics at the University, he gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Aitken's publications include: jointly with H. W. Turnbull,The theory of canonical matrices(1932); with D. E. Rutherford, a series of Mathematical Texts; wartime experiences inGallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand infantryman(1963); and, posthumouslyTo catch the spirit. The memoir of A.C. Aitken with a biographical introduction by P.C. Fenton(1995). He made many important contributions to the many fields of his subject, particularly in the theory of Matrix Algebra and its application to various branches of mathematics. In his time, Professor Aitken was one of the fastest mathematical calculators in the world. While at school, Aitken had learned to play the violin, and later on in life he played both the violin and viola and composed pieces for performance by university groups. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967.

Walter Ledermann was born on 18 Mar 1911, the second of William and Charlotte Ledermann's four children, in Berlin, Germany. His Father was a physician, though the family was accustomed to poverty following World War I and the depression of the 1920s. Ledermann was a promising student from an early age, and a keen violinist. He received his leaving certificate from the Leibniz Gymnasium early due to his performance in classics and mathematics, which allowed him to complete his degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Berlin. There he encountered several mathematicians and physicists of note who inspired him, including Issai Schur, Heinz Hopf, Max Plank, and Erwin Shrodinger.  On completion of his degree, it became clear to Ledermann that he could no longer stay in Germany. He won a scholarship created by students at St Andrews to support a Jewish refugee, during which time his brother was working in Edinburgh to gain a medical qualification. Ledermann was awarded his PhD after two years.  Encouraged by Professor Turnbull of St Andrews University, Ledermann sought an interview with Professor Edmund Whittaker (later Sir) at the University of Edinburgh with a view to seeking employment there. Whittaker invited him to come as a visiting student to Edinburgh for one term, offering him a bursary of Â£50 and encouraging him to attend the lectures of A C Aitken. Aitken quickly became a friend to Ledermann, and introduced him to Godfrey Thomson, Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and Director of Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). At that time, Thomson required a mathematical assistant for a Carnegie funded project which would eventually result in the publication of his seminal book, The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and he immediately offered Ledermann the post. It is from this period that the majority of Ledermann's papers, which largely comprise of letters from Thomson, were created. Ledermann's work with Thomson was interrupted for 6 months in 1937 when Ledermann accepted a post teaching at the University of Dundee. He returned to work with Thomson in Edinburgh until 1938, when he took a lecturer's post in the University of St Andrews. In 1940, Ledermann's naturalization was completed, and he was also awarded his DSc from the University of Edinburgh. He married his wife, Ruth Ledermann, a social worker, in 1946, later having a son, Jonathon. The couple moved to Manchester, where Ledermann was worked as a lecturer in pure mathematics in the University of Manchester, from 1946-1962.  In 1962 Ledermann gained a lecture post at the new University of Sussex, where he eventually became a professor. He found the atmosphere of the modern university highly stimulating, and taught for two further years past the statutory age of retirement (then 65). Even after his official retirement in 1978, Ledermann continued to give occasional courses and revision classes to his students until 1997, when he and Ruth, by then a psychotherapist, moved to London. Ledermann died in London on 22 May 2009.

These notes relate to Beale's work on intragenic recombination among the antigen-determining genes in Paramecium. Beale constructed heterozygotes involving various combinations of different 'd' antigen alleles, passed them through autogamy and screened the progeny with sera capable of immobilising the parental types. Theoretically intragenic recombinants should have appeared, but the only novel types Beale got turned out to be 'nuls' - i.e. cells unable to express any antigen controlled by the locus corresponding to the original types used.

Alan Owen was born in Inverness on 2 September 1922. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy. At the time of starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1939, his family still lived in Inverness. At University he followed classes in English and British History between 1939 and 1940, English and Philosophy from 1940 to 1941, then Latin, Psychology and Geography from 1941 to 1942. War service presumably followed because he did not graduate with the degree of MA until June 1946. Thereafter he was awarded the diploma and degree of Dip.Ed. (1947) and B.Ed. (1948). Anne Hyslop Gemmell was born in Coalburn, Lanarkshire, on 16 June 1923. She was educated at Ormiston Public School and at schools in Wishaw and Cumnock. At the time of her starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1941, her family still lived in Ormiston. At University she followed classes in French, German and Political Economy between 1941 and 1942, French and German during 1942 and 1943, then Psychology, Moral Philosophy and Economic History between 1945 and 1946. She graduated in January 1945, and was awarded a Diploma in Social Study in 1947. Both Alan Owen and Anne Hyslop Gemmell were members and associates of the XIIth International Congress of Pyschology held in Edinburgh at the University of Edinburgh between 23 July and 29 July 1948.

A copy from perhaps 1763 of the manuscript account of the escape of Archibald Bower (1686-1766), a Scottish historian, from the Inquisition, 'Taken from his own mouth, by a Lady'. Archibald Bower was born at or near Dundee in 1685-1686. He was educated at the Scots College, Douai, which had been established in 1594 for the training of Scottish Roman Catholic exiles. Afterwards he went to Rome, and was admitted into the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1706. Bower then spent time in Fano, Arezzo, Florence, Macerata, and Perugia. The reasons for his flight from Perugia in 1726 are varied. Some say that he had been caught with a nun, but Bower himself said that it was because of the terrible proceedings of the Court of the Inquisition at Macerata, in which he said that he was counsellor or judge. He later returned to the Church of England. His own manuscript account of his escape had circulated in a number of versions during the eighteenth century. Archibald Bower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard.

The civil engineer Thomas Archibald Campbell Brownlie was born on 6 September 1914, in Kasauli, India. His parents were Thomas Archibald Miller Brownlie (1879-1962) a civil engineer working in Faisalabad (now in modern Pakistan) and Jessie Forsyth Brownlie (Smith). When still a child he was brought to Scotland by his mother to live near Dunoon. After local early education he later went to Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, and then he studied Engineering at Edinburgh University. He graduated with the degree of B.Sc. in 1935 and then returned to India, working in the Punjab where he was involved in canal work. During World War II he served in the Indian Army as a Major, with the Bengal Sappers and Miners, commanding a company in Malaya and Burma. During the war, on 5 August 1941, he married Marjorie Bennetts (1921-2011). After the war (and Indian independence), Brownlie returned to Scotland and worked with the local authorities of both Dumfries and Fife. In 1950, he became County Engineer with Midlothian County Council before joining Lothian Region on the re-organisation of Scottish local government. Latterly he was Director of the Region's drainage services (Director of Drainage), and he had been responsible for its biggest single capital project - the multi-million pound Edinburgh Sewage Disposal Scheme including its sewage treatment plant at Seafield and the means to transfer sludge to the vessel M.V. 'Gardyloo' for disposal in the near North Sea. He retired from Lothian Region in September 1978. Thomas Archibald Campbell Brownlie died on 3 September 2010.

The project 'Platform technologies underpinning human embryonic stem cell derivation' operated from Roslin Institute's Division of Gene Expression and Development, of which Ian Wilmut was then Head. The project, led by Paul De Sousa, and which necessitated the use for research of oocytes and embryos, aimed to develop methods to derive human embryonic stem (hES) cells from fresh or frozen embryos which were surplus to IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis treatment, or parthenogenetic embryos originating from eggs matured in vitro; and to derive and maintain hES cells in a culture environment free of animal cell products. Roslin Institute first acquired a HFEA license for this project in July 2003. In February 2004, a variation to the license was granted to permit embryo donors to consent to the possible future therapeutic use of newly derived stem cells (R0136-1-b).
The project 'Derivation of research and therapeutic grade human embryonic stem cells', led by Paul De Sousa, began in July 2007 and aimed to derive and market research therapeutic-grade human embryonic stem cells under the not-for-profit company Roslin Cells Ltd.

James Stanley Cavaye was born in 1914. He served as a Councillor in Edinburgh. He was first elected as a Progressive to the old City of Edinburgh Corporation in 1970 and switched to the Conservatives two years later. When local government was reorganised in 1974 he successfully stood as a Tory for both Lothian Regional Council and Edinburgh District Council. His working life was spent in Portobello Power Station, originally run by the municipal Electricity Department, latterly the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Cavaye had been a collector of glass-plate slides for 'magic lantern shows', buying these in the small junk shops that used to be found in Edinburgh's Grassmarket and the West Bow. He found and saved the Begbie Collection of very early glass-plate photographs of Edinburgh. They were found in a flat in St. James Square in 1950. He gifted the plates to the City Arts Centre, Edinburgh, in 1990. The gift is known as the 'Cavaye Collection of Thomas Begbie Plates'. He was a founder and former Chair of the Edinburgh Festival Volunteer Guides Association (set up in 1947) which gave tours of the Royal Mile. He also gave lectures on the history of Edinburgh. Stanley Cavaye died in 2004. He was buried at Liberton Cemetary on Thursday 12 February 2004.

James Campbell was born at Carsphairn (Dumfries and Galloway), on 16 July 1789, to William Campbell (1755-1829) and his wife Agnes (nee Riggs) (1760-1838). He studied for the ministry at Glasgow University (matriculated 1806) and was licensed by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright on 7 May 1817. He spent time as tutor to the Hart family of Castlemilk, and travelled to France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with them (around 1814). He was with them during their flight from France when Napoleon returned to power. On his return to Scotland he searched for a suitable parish, and became tutor to the family of Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie in Traquair parish. He was ordained as Minister of Traquair (Church of St. Bride) in September 1820, having been presented by George, Prince Regent, in January 1820. Campbell spent his whole ministerial career in Traquair. On 26 October 1820 James Campbell married Mary Combe (d. 1860), daughter of Matthew Combe, a Leith brewer. One of their daughters, Agnes Mary Campbell, married Jardine Wallace (1834-1910) who succeeded James Campbell as Minister at Traquair. James Campbell died on 29 April 1861, aged 71.

John Donaldson was born in 1789. He studied Law and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1826, though he was also a well-known teacher of music in Edinburgh. Though unsuccessful in his earlier candidacy in 1841, he was elected to the Reid Professorship of Music at Edinburgh University in 1845 on the death of Professor John Thomson. It was Donaldson who established a museum and purchased old and unusual musical instruments which today forms the John Donaldson Collection. As well as founding this collection which illustrates the history of music and acoustics, he built a fine hall as his music classroom with adjoining museum gallery, now known as the Reid Concert Hall. An organ built by Messrs. Hill and Sons (London) was constructed in the music classroom. It is said that Donaldson's lectures were not especially successful because he was not a practical musician, devoting himself rather more to the theory of harmony and investigating obscure questions of acoustics. Nevertheless, he held the Professorship until his death at Marchfield, his home near Edinburgh, on 12 August 1865.

Ursula Mary Keppel-Compton was born in Southampton, England, in 1907. She was a graduate of Oxford University, St. Hugh's College, and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York from which she graduated as Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.). In 1931 she married the American theologian Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971). They made New York City their home. During the 1930s she was a lay minister preaching in Anglican churches and in this capacity she raised questions about the the role of women in the church. From 1940, and first as a lecturer, she was a member of the Barnard College faculty for some 20 years. She retired in the 1960s and died on 10 January 1997. John Baillie was born in 1886. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force, then an academic career followed. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retiral six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, becoming a President of the latter. He died in 1960.

Sir Henry Hadow was in office between 1909 -1918, during which he occupied the roles of principle of Armstrong College and Warden & Vice Chancellor of the University of Durham respectively. The lectures most likely date between 1916-1918, when Hadow was still in office and Thomson was Reader in Education.

Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.

George McDonald Sutherland was born in 1886, the son of a master-mason George P. Sutherland. This elder Sutherland, educated at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, had served as an apprentice sculptor in Edinburgh, London and New York, and in 1881 had founded the firm of George Sutherland and Sons (Galashiels), Sculptors and Monumental Masons. The firm operated throughout the Borders over the next 100 years, with war memorials and grave stones comprising a large part of the business, and ran additional businesses in Hawick and in Tweedmouth. The carvings on the local Galashiels Post Office building were created by Sutherland in 1886. The younger George McDonald Sutherland had been apprenticed as a young architect to the firm of Sir Robert Lorimer in 1903, at the age of 17. He subsequently went to Toronto, Canada, to start an architectural business and bought land there too. On the outbreak of the Great War however, he came back to Scotland to enlist and joined the 4th King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB). Sadly he was killed at Arras on 9 April 1917 and was buried there.

First-class cricketer Harry Lindsay Somerled MacDonald was born in Westminster, London, on 2 August 1861. He was the grandson of Donald Macdonald, of Sandside, Caithness, and was the only son of Lt-Col. William Donald MacDonald of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (1827-1862) and Miss Emma Anne Elizabeth Lindsay (married in 1860).  The younger MacDonald was himself commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Fife division of the Royal Artillery in 1879. In 1883, he was promoted from Lieutenant to Captain in the fourth brigade of the Scottish Division of the Royal Artillery. He resigned his commission in 1887 and resigned from the reserve of officers in 1892.  Earlier, on 12 July 1887, he married Lillian Margaret Coke (daughter of R.G.Coke Esq) of Brimington Hall, Derbyshire, and the pair settled in Bathford, near Bath. MacDonald played club cricket in the Bath area of Somerset in the 1890s. Harry Lindsay Somerled MacDonald died at Bathford, Somerset, on 15 August 1936.

Gerald Henry Elliot was born in Edinburgh on 24 December 1923. His parents were Captain J. S. Elliot RN and Magda Salvesen. He was educated at Marlborough College and then he studied at New College, Oxford, where he graduated with the degree of BA PPE in 1948. During the Second World War, he served as a Captain with the FF Rifles, Indian Army (Frontier Force), 1942-1946. Elliot joined the family firm of Christian Salvesen and Company in 1948 and quickly became involved in its whaling operations, making his first trip to South Georgia just two months after his appointment. He slowly took over the management of the whaling fleet from his uncle, Harold Salvesen, and was involved in improving processing methods, the rationalisation of whale catches, ordering of supplies and overseeing recruitment. In 1950, he married Margaret Ruth Whale, daughter of the Rev. J. S. Whale. Following the cessation of whaling in the 1960s Elliot became involved in Salvesen's fishing interests in South America. He retired from the company (Christian Salvesen plc) in 1988 having been its Chairman since 1981. He was knighted in 1986. His wife, Lady Elliot, has also been honoured, receiving an MBE in 1993. In October 2007, the French based transport and logistics provider Norbert Dentressangle announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Christian Salvesen. It has been observed that the decision of the Salvesen firm, chaired by Sir Gerald H. Elliot, to sell two disused whaling stations on South Georgia to Constantino Davidoff, an Argentinean scrap merchant, led inadvertently to the Falkland islands conflict. When an Argentinean scrap team arrived at South Georgia in March 1982 it was aboard an Argentinean warship. The Argentinean flag was raised on South Georgia and Argentinean troops seized the Falklands two weeks later. In 1998 Sir Gerald published A Whaling Enterprise: Salvesen in the Antarctic detailing the history of Salvesen's whaling interests, the lives of whalers and the technical and economic frameworks which supported the industry. He has also written papers on the control of whaling and fishing, arts administration and economic management. Sir Gerald Elliot has also been a Director of the Scottish Provident Institution, 1971-1989, and then Chairman 1983-1989, and Chairman of the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust, 1987-1994. He has been a Trustee of the National Museums of Scotland, 1987-1991, and a member of the Court, Edinburgh University, 1984-1993. He has held many other positions too in commerical and public organisations. In addition to his knighthood awarded in 1986, Sir Gerald is also a Knight First Class of the Order of the White Rose of Finland.

Willa Muir was born Wilhelmina Johnston Anderson on the Shetland island of Unst in 1890. She was brought up in Montrose, Angus, before studying at St. Andrews - one of the first women to study for a University degree. In 1910, she graduated with a degree in Classics. She became Vice-Principal of a teacher training college in London, but left in 1919 when she married the critic and poet, Edwin Muir (1887-1959) who became one of the central figures of the modern Scottish cultural renaissance. During the First World War years, Willa Muir undertook postgraduate study in psychology and was interested in the then relatively recent work of Freud and Jung into the unconscious mind and the interpretation of dreams. The inter-war years saw the Muirs travelling Europe - the then new Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria and Italy - absorbing developments in European literature and translating more than forty novels, the best known being works of Kafka. The more able linguist of the two, she was probably the main translator in these projects, also translating many books herself, under the name of Agnes Neill Scott.  Willa Muir wrote only two novels: Imagined Corners (1931); and, Mrs Ritchie (1933). Both explored the conventions of small town Scottish life, and the effects of Calvinism, and the limitations experienced by women in these settings. In 1936 she wrote two extended essays: Mrs Grundy in Scotland and Women in Scotland, and these examined the roles open to women in contemporary Scotland. After the death of Edwin Muir, she wrote an account of their life together, Belonging: A Memoir (1968). She also wrote a study of oral poetry, Living with Ballads (1965).  Willa Muir died on 22 May 1970. Vernon Phillips Watkins, born at Maesteg, Glamorgan, on 27 June 1906, was a British poet, translator and painter. He went to Swansea Grammar School, the preparatory school of Tyttenhanger Lodge, Seaford, Sussex, and to Repton School, Derbyshire. He briefly studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, reading French and German, but did not continue, and worked in banking instead. Always, from a very early age, Watkins had been devoted to the English Romantic poets, and he himself emerged as a poet. He would become one of the very few metaphysical poets of the twentieth century and probably the most distinguished. He was a close friend of Dylan Thomas. During the Second World War he served in the R.A.F. Police and in Intelligence (1941-1946). He married a colleague of his from Intelligence in 1944. Watkins lived all his adult life in Gower, and after his marriage he lived at 'The Garth' on Pennard Cliffs. He received many literary prizes, and was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of Wales in 1966 and became a Gulbenkian Scholar at University College, Swansea. Vernon Watkins died in Seattle on 8 October 1967 during his stay as Visiting Professor of Poetry at the University of Washington.

In the 17th century, glass slides were already being projected using a 'magic lantern' - or early form of the projector. However, in 1850, in Philadelphia, USA, the transparent positive image of a photograph in the form of a glass slide was invented by William and Frederick Langenheim - two Daguerreotypists. Their 'hyalotype' (from Greek 'hyalo' for glass) or black and white photographic glass slide could be projected onto a wall or screen using a 'magic lantern' lit by oil lamps. By 1870, limelight - a dazzling white light produced by directing a very hot flame onto the surface of a pellet of lime - offered a better, although more dangerous, form of illumination. The earliest and simplest form of limelight was the oxy-calcium lamp. The flame of a spirit lamp was placed near the pellet of lime and a jet of oxygen was used to raise the temperature of the flame and force it against the surface of the lime to produce its brilliant white light. An even brighter limelight could be produced using an oxygen and hydrogen jet. In the 1890s, the invention of the carbon arc lamp, followed by electric light, provided a safe method for displaying the lantern slide image. By 1873, Bruno Meyer, a German art historian at the Polytechnic Institute in Karlsruhe, was using projected lantern slides in art history lectures, and actually started to manufacture what he called 'glasphotogramme' which he sold at two marks a piece. When the new electric 'magic lantern' projectors were introduced in 1892, the technology was enthusiastically adopted by Hermann Grimm, a professor of art history at the University of Berlin. In an article published in 1897, he reported how lantern slides permitted the projection of works full-size, or allowed small works or fragments to be enlarged to colossal scale. Grimm's successor at Berlin was Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin who also embraced the new technology In 1916, a process for producing colour lantern slides had been invented by the German company Agfa, but because of the war it did not become available outside Germany until the 1920s. Use of lantern slides lasted until the 1950s when their popularity began to decline with the introduction of smaller transparencies and then, finally, in 1936, the discovery of the Kodachrome three-color process made the 35mm format slides less expensive to produce than lantern slides. Beginning in 1938, the transparencies were presented in the now familiar card mounts. Although the production of lantern slides ended in the 1950s, many academic slide collections still house and use glass slides. In some cases, the views that they represent are either drastically changed or no longer exist and thus they are invaluable images of the world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

This is a manuscript common-place book of original lyric verse, from c. 1827-1839, and with numerous pen and ink drawings and watercolours. The poems are mostly of a sentimental religious nature, distinctly rural, and with a few of a topical nature. Topical lines include an opening poem on Napoleon, the death of Canning, the death of the opera-singer Maria Malibran, and one on the accession of Queen Victoria. Some are family orientated and include watercolour portraits - 'Letitia. On her return from Bath 21 Dec. 1837' and 'On Ben's birth day, 12 November 1837'. There is a poem entitled 'Crypt Bells' referring to Gloucester's 'Cloister'd scenes', which together with the reference to Bath may offer a clue to the location of the unknown writer.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

The Scottish Widows Fund and Equitable Assurance Society, or Scottish Widows, was established in 1815 in Edinburgh. The idea for the setting up of a fund for the financial protection of the relatives of deceased clergyman and schoolmasters had been put forward by a group of prominent Scotsmen in March 1812. The fund would protect 'widows, sisters and other females' from poverty, and would be achieved by insuring capital sums on lives. The plan was extend the benefits of the fund to all parts of Britain. By September 1821, funds had reached Â£20,000, and in 1845 they stood at Â£1,700,000. In our own modern times Scottish Widows became part of Lloyds TSB Group.

A. W. S. Thompson graduated with the degree of M.B. in 1933. During the Second World War, Thompson was sent overseas to North Africa and Italy and the Middle East from 1943 onwards with, principally, the Royal Army Medical Corps and the 8th Army. He served as a hygiene officer with the Field Hygiene Section and Mobile Hygiene Section, and was a Major then Lieutenant-Colonel. Latterly, in the late-1960s, Dr. Thompson was Director, Division of Clinical Services, at the Department of Health in Wellington, New Zealand. In the late-1970s, he was living in Dorset, England.

Thomson argues that the British education system needs to make provision for vocational training, citing, in some detail, Germany's extensive system of vocational training as an example.  He stresses that the vocational training undertaken through the necessities of war should be carried on through peacetime, ensuring it is integrated into the existing educational system and valued, and outlines the history and decline of apprenticeship and vocational education in Britain between the 17th and 19th centuries.

Thomson expresses his disappointment over the decision of the Faculty of Science not allowing Ledermann to submit his DSc. He encourages him to speak to staff at St Andrews and make a formal application, and tells him he will speak to both Edinburgh University and St Andrews University if this is unsuccessful. Thomson comments that C Spearman has written an Anti-Thomson article in the British Journal of Psychology, and tells him that The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability should be published very soon. He comments that Ledermann must have had an anxious time in the last few months, and enquires as to how his family are in Palestine.
|
The letters regard a post at the Francis Galton Laboratory in University College London, which Pearson offered to Thomson on the strength of his publications, not having met him by this point. The letter also discusses an article by Thomson regarding Spearman's work, and its suitability for Biometrika.

The collection is composed of an imposing photograph of John A. W. Dollar, circa 1904-1905, in his presidential robes - President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons - and a bill with engraved bill-head of the Dollar veterinary practice on New Bond Street, London, with a fine engraved bill-head, a rare survival. The portrait was taken by the firm Elliott and Fry, 55 Baker Street, London W, and is numbered in pencil as No.206440D. The bill with engraved bill-head is dated in ink, 1901. It is the account between January 1901 and December 1901 with J. E. Taylor esq., Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and includes interesting information about veterinary costs in the early months of the 20th century - e.g. a 'nailing' presumably for a horse-shoe costing one shilling (January 16), four shoes for six shillings (April 1), and attendance, advice and a bottle of lotion for eight shillings and sixpence (June 13).

Four letters of Isaac Forsyth, bookseller in ElginLetter sent by Isaac Forsyth to Patrick Duff, originally enclosing prospectus relating to a book by 'Dr Falconer of Forres', whom Forsyth describes as 'a gigantic geologist'. He is very probably talking of Hugh Falconer (1808-1865), a Scottish geologist, botanist and palaeontologist who studied the flora and fauna in India and Burma. Forsyth mentions the 'two hundred chests' Falconer brought back from India in 1842, and says that their contents 'would be worth a dash to London in a steamer even if [they] should pay twa shillings for a Finnan Haddock in passing thro' canny Aberdeen-aura' [area?]. Isaac Forsyth and Patrick were parts of a group of Elgin men who set up a Sciences museum in Elgin during the 1830s-1840s.Letter to Colonel Brades, relating to unsold tickets - and cash for tickets sold - at event to be held at Exeter Hall in the StrandLetter of 24th November 1851, offering thanks for sack of Swedish turnips deliveredLetter of 1857, relating to a book to be boundLetter of 1857 relating to plates in Elgin Cathedral

The letter was written by Hugh MacDiarmid on 30 August 1958 from 'Brownsbank', Candymill, Biggar, Lanarkshire. It is addressed to Dr. Ringsleben - Mary Ringsleben having been awarded her Ph.D. two years earlier in 1956 (Aberdeen). MacDiarmid apologises for having 'retained your thesis so long'. He refers to having seen Dr. David Murison (deputy editor of the Scottish National Dictionary) in Edinburgh and that he had 'just missed you'. He describes the Ringsleben thesis as 'an excellent one and certainly the best thing written on Douglas by far'. He goes on to say that he is 'not going to make any little critical observations' apart from 'wishing to see it expanded and published'. Because it is 'on the short side for a book', he hopes she 'may decide to expand it'. MacDiarmid agrees 'in toto with all the main substance' of the study, and hopes that other subjects in Scots literature may attract her attention.

Terraces on Arthur's Seat could refer to other theories about their origins: "? Traces of trenches thrown up (1778) by mutinous Seaforth Highlanders. Discontent having arisen in connection with their departure for India, several hundreds of men attacked their officers on the Esplanade, and then held their position there (i.e. on Arthur's Seat) for several days until a free pardon was offered them." ('The New Illustrated Guide to Edinburgh' 10th ed. By John Reid, Pub: Andrew Elliot, 1905, p. 87). Hearsay also suggests, perhaps confusing this report, that the terraces are the remains of fortifications dug during the Napoleonic War when invasion was threatened. It is also possible that they may have used older terraces mentioned by Frank Mears.

Three copies of manuscript letters from Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) to Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji are dated 25 May 1926 from Montrose, 5 January 1932 from London, and 19 August 1955 from Lanarkshire. The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

In the lecture, Thomson defends the use of examinations, arguing that they are preferable to nepotism. In addition, he identifies the problems of examinations, and how these may or have been resolved, including those of reliability and continuity of standards.  Thomson discusses the merits of internal versus external examination, giving examples from Scotland, England and Germany, and referencing some of his own experience both as a member of a School Certificate Examination Board and as an examination candidate himself, including his meeting aged 17 with Silvanus Thompson, who was one of his examiners from the London external B. Sc. Also includes a set of rough notes regarding the speech, with notes regarding sociological research in the British colonies.

He outlines these difficulties with several pages of explanatory working.  Written on the back of several copies of the preliminary notice for the twelfth International Congress of Psychology.

The lecture explores how schools could, and should, benefit the whole community by giving pupils a happy, clean environment which serves as a model for what the home should be, and by giving them the knowledge and skills in order to work towards solving practical and social problems in their communities.  He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.

Ledermann informs Thomson that Professor Turnbull of St Andrews has advised him against taking any action regarding his DSc degree at St Andrews. Ledermann asks Thomson if he can do anything to help matters in Edinburgh, such as pointing out that Ledermann had begun working for Thomson before his period of research officially started. He also mentions that he has received proofs of his article from Biometrika, and informs Thomson that his parents and younger sister are now in London.

The lecture outlines how science can fulfil its main purpose, in Thomson's opinion, that of uniting society. Thomson describes his own education â both formal and informal â and his current role as a lecturer in education, and explains how these have informed his beliefs regarding scientific training.  He makes the case that science has often operated in isolation both from the world around it, and from the native language of its practitioners, with science students dependant on the language of symbols and formulae and incapable, or unwilling, to render their ideas into English.  He stresses the importance that science should be taught in such a way as to enable the student to see its relevance to the wider world and to culture; and the importance that students are not taught to simply accept hypothesis and formula without understanding or questioning.

In this scene (Coll-1167/PSE/A/1), the Esplanade probably had a gravel surface, hence the visible effects of rain. It was used as a parade ground for the garrison of the Castle, which, until the erection of the Redford Barracks (completed 1915), was the principal military location in the Edinburgh district. Note the tarmacadam road, bounded by the bollards in front, which encircles the ground. Note that this print and the next four, (to Coll-1167/PSE/A/5), do not show the Scottish National War Memorial, built 1924-27 in the reconstructed North Barracks, ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam and Walker).

Thomson compares the American high school system to the English secondary school system. He argues that there is much to be learned from the American system which, as a result of offering a free education up to 18 for all who wish it and are able, relies on a more varied curriculum which incorporates social and vocational education alongside more academic subjects such as English, Mathematics, classics and science. Thomson reasons that more provision should be made in England for average students who wish to learn vocational subjects. He makes a case for a school model similar to that of America. However, rather than having students of different ability in the same schools, which he argues lowers existing standards, he proposes new schools should be created for the purpose of teaching more social and vocational subjects as in America He also discusses the finance of education â both secondary schools and universities â in America, with particular reference to variation between States; the fact of compulsory military training at some free State universities and private schools; and the American technique of "work-study-play" or platoon schools, in which children change activity and location throughout the school day.

The letter (E2010.18), placed and dated as Dunfermline 10 April 1741, refers to a letter from Whitefield written on the 'Minerva' 17 February. It refers too to Mr. Wilson 'in Perth who teacheth as our professor of divinity'. The letter lists previous communication between Erskine and Whitefield one of which (from Bohemia in Maryland) Erskine has 'received not'. The others mentioned are: a letter from Whitefield from Philadelphia on 8 November; and, one from Savannah on 16 January 1740. Referring to Whitefield's inclination to visit Scotland, Erskine writes that 'There is no face on Earth I would desire more earnestly to see than yours and there is none would be more welcome than you'. A large part of the letter describes the religious climate in Scotland at the time. The letter is addressed to 'The Rev.rd Mr. George Whitefield at the House of Mr Peter Sims in the Paved Alley, Leaden-hall, London'.

Thomson discusses the importance of discipline in class both in a general sense, and specifically relating to music classes. He discusses the pitfalls of both too lenient and too harsh discipline; the importance of forming rules and ensuring these are as clear and as few as possible; the participation of pupils in rule making and reporting when rules are broken; and assigning a fitting punishment. He also gives pointers for achieving discipline, and stresses the responsibilities the teacher must undertake, including keeping proper records of students' progress and attendance, paying attention to the class, learning their names and being observant; and ensuring students' work is properly marked and good work rewarded.

Thomson also wishes Ledermann and his family a Happy New Year, and asks Ledermann about the university examinations process in Germany, telling him of his own experience. Thomson discusses dice throwing, referring to his own article, a Hierarchy without a General Factor, from the British Journal of Psychology, and his own experiments with dice. The letter is written on the back of several tables and graphs regarding intelligence. It is unclear which report or article these are from, but they feature titles including Reading and Spelling: differences in mean AQ for LE and RE boys and girls; Reading Accomplishment in association with Incidence of Left-and Right-eye dominancy; Distribution of IQs in association with incidence of Left- and Right eye Dominancy; and Percentages of Total Retarded Group in Categories of Accomplishment and Intelligence. Also includes a note from Derrick Lawley indicating he is returning the letter to Ledermann after Ledermann forgot it.

This L-shaped room, with the other 'leg' at right-angles beyond the curtain on the left, now accommodates the Patrick Geddes Centre of the University of Edinburgh, appropriately since Geddes himself worked here. It is on the fourth floor of the Outlook Tower; the right-hand window commands a view of the Castle, the left-hand one of south Edinburgh to the Pentlands, and the others, at the end of the 'leg' and behind the camera, down to the Lawnmarket and over north Edinburgh.

The photographs consist mainly of photographs of Alan Greenwood, staff from the Institute of Animal Genetics and Poultry Research Centre, their relations and visitors, and various events and conferences. There are also a number of photographs showing the construction and opening of the Poultry Research Centre building at Kings Buildings and the sub-station at Easter Bush. There appears to be a combination of official photographs taken, for instance, for a publication, and more informal snapshots. The photographs are mounted on sheets of foolscap paper which have been hole-punched and have presumably been removed from a folder at an earlier stage. The subjects of the pictures are often annotated, probably by Alan Greenwood.  Some sheets have photographs mounted on both sides, while other sheets have clearly had photographs removed. Except where noted, the photographs are in black and white. Many of the photographs are signed 'M.L', which denotes Miron Latyszewski, at that time a research officer at the Institute of Animal Genetics.

Thomson discusses the limitations of intelligence testing, and its positive qualities, citing its objectivity and scientific basis. He outlines the processes involved in trialling the tests to establish their suitability and reliability, describing how the final order and content of the paper is decided; the difficulties involved in obtaining a representative sample of children; the need to incentivise children to do their best in the trial test, and the process of standardisation of test results and the creation of norms for each age group. He also touches upon the relationship between age and test performance within pupils at the same educational level. Thomson describes the distribution of IQ levels shown by such tests, and how teachers might use these to predict and plan for educational attainment.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland â Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter
from Granville Bantock to Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, dated 25 Jul 1924, is in Gen. 278.  Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Any

Thomson defines educational science, which he sees as having two facets: operational, such as the research undertaken by the Scottish Council for Research in Education regarding the best teaching methods; and fundamental, such as research undertaken to explore the sources of intelligence differences, and their relationship to one another. Thomson charts how educational science has progressed, due in part to the use of mathematical statistics and the increasing use of quantitative measurements. He cites the application of statistical tests to the results of educational experiments to determine their significance as an example. Thomson looks closely at the issue of nature versus nurture, making particular reference to the Scottish Mental Surveys, and studies carried out on siblings and twins. He talks about both the usefulness and limitations of intelligence testing, and the possibilities of factor analysis in identifying the different abilities within an individual's mind. He describes some issues he thinks are worthy of investigation by educational science, including the notion of transfer beyond school, selection for secondary school and further education, techniques for memorising in the classroom, and propaganda in the classroom.

At E87.71 there is a letter of Chalmers written at the 'Office for Trade, Whitehall' on 21 July 1788, to the sister of 'the late Mr. Richardson of Kensington' (William Richardson). The letter refers to his objective of doing 'justice to the memory of' Richardson, and goes on to mention the 'essay on the causes of the decline of Foreign trade, which I think was written by Mr. Richardson'. In the letter he says that the essay 'is very generally attributed to Sir Matthew Decker'. He hopes though that he might be informed 'of some facts and circumstances which would enable' him to settle the 'doubtful point in favour' of the woman's brother. He asks if she knows of any papers remaining 'which prove that Mr. Richardson wrote this essay, or anything else'. Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679-1749) was an English merchant and writer on trade, an MP, and director of the East India Company.

Thomson outlines how individuals make associations between ideas â both logical associations and unique associations which have occurred to the individual by chance â and how this aids memory.  He describes the unique way in which music creates associations; stresses the importance in allowing children to make their own associations, thus encouraging creativity and discovery; and discusses how the lecturer can utilise both associations and generalisations.

In the lecture, Thomson outlines his utilitarian educational creed, which involves the greatest happiness of the greatest number. He makes a moral and ethical case for this, and contrasts and balances it with the concept of truth, as well as the needs of the individual, particularly the cultivation and encouragement of genius and talent.  Thomson relates this creed back to educational systems and problems, summarising the sometimes conflicting demands each section of the community has of education: school pupils, parents, employers, communities, and government. He touches on the importance of literacy and the attitudes of the ruling classes to its rise, as well as the issue of propaganda in schools.

The letter is dated 28 February 1887, at 10 Bright['s] Crescent, presumably in Edinburgh. It appears to begin, 'Dear Prof. Dunn'. Geikie regrets that he 'shall be unable to attend the Council meeting for t. night - I am not allowed to go out in the evening'. He remarks how it is 'a terrible loss to the Society in the death of our dear friend Mr. Gray!' It finishes with autograph signature, James Geikie. There is also a printed outline map of Scotland showing principal directions of ice-flow. Both the map and the letter (which had been pasted to the inside cover) had been extracted from a copy of Geikie's Great Ice Age and its relation to the antiquity of man (1874).

Thomson parallels and compares competition in the natural world, where the weakest are eliminated and education through play prepares the individual for their environment, with that in the human world, where co-operation protects the unfit and education contributes to a differential birth rate.  He discusses possible reasons for the connection between intelligence, education, and family size, exploring whether this phenomenon is due to genetics, environment, or both. He refers to intelligence testing he has conducted throughout several counties in England, including that of an English mining community and a concurrent test on Fatherless children; and testing carried out by the Mental Defective Committee establishing an increase in the incidence of mental defect.  Thomson outlines the ethical implications of such findings, and how imperative it is that all individuals be offered the best free education they can use. He argues that education is a crucial part of the solution to the differential birth rate.

Thomson discusses how habit creates dexterity, referring particularly to the playing of a musical instrument, and the premise that frequent practice is more beneficial than long practice.  He discusses the importance of challenging students and ensuring the level of attainment results in an increase in the level of difficulty; and he compares the effectiveness of the entire and parts methods of memorising, in relation to music practice.

Octavo. 11 sheets (13 x 17.5 cm) of fine art paper preserved in a marbled paper folder comprising a decorated title-page followed by the text, with a pen-and-ink drawing at the tope of each page (save the last which closes with a decorated 'Finis'). One of the drawings has been coloured. The illustrations are typical of Mclaren's illustrative at its finest. The initials on the back ('HM') would seem to suggest that this is the recipient of the portfolio. The drawings include those illustrating: the 'shore of silver-streaming Thames'; a 'flock of nymphs [...] each one had a little wicker basket's; the 'two swans of goodly hue'; the 'nymphs, which now had flowers their fill'; the 'baskets [...] store of flowers'; a spray of flowers being perhaps 'the world's fair ornament'; nymphs, swans and flowers; 'Sweet Thames' with skyline and bridge; Queen Elizabeth, 'Great England's glory and the world's wide wonder'; and, the 'Finis' in which 'I end my song'.

The letter was written in St. Petersburg, on Grande Morskaia (Bolshaia Morskaia, or Morskaya Street), on 2nd or 15th May 1901, by W. Sedgefield, and addressed to his 'Dear Uncle', W. J. Sedgefield, Esq., Abingdon, Berkshire, England. The envelope, with franking and partial postage stamp, survives. The letter describes the 'annual spring parade of the troops quartered in and around St. P[etersburg]' which took place 'yesterday' - yesterday being 1 May 1901 - on the 'Field of Mars'. Sedgefield was accompanied by ' an intelligent Russian boy', a pupil of his, and whose male relatives were soldiers - 'fathers and uncles being generals and his brothers officers in crack regiments'. The parade took place in front of the Emperor. 'After a long wait the Emperor appeared riding along side of a state carriage drawn by white horses, containing the two Empresses'. One of these ladies was presumably the Empress Dowager.  The letter contains descriptions of the regiments involved in the parade, and description of the horses involved.

In the first letter, dated 15 Jan 1938 and numbered 8a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that his [Thomson's] manuscript regarding univariate selection has been sent back to him by F C Bartlett, as the publisher requires it typed, and advises him that his own manuscript has likely been sent back for the same reason.  In the second letter, dated 17 Jan 1938 and numbered 8b (38), Thomson asks Ledermann to check the Psychometric offprints for any misprints. He refers to work by Dodd he had originally enclosed on loan from J Neyman. This has not survived in the collection.

The back of the present (1989) Deaconess Hospital is visible at the far end of the back greens, (the front is in the Pleasance, see Coll-1167/PSE/T/2). This building, now much altered and extended, dates from 1894 ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam & Walker). Carnegie Street, not visible, was on the left; Brown Street, of which the back is shown here, on the right. The square-roofed extension at the left back of the hospital can still be identified, though a storey has been added. The three-storey separate building on the left no longer exists; perhaps it was an annex or staff quarters. This view is looking west.

The North British Station Hotel, former General Post Office building, with Nelson Monument beyond, and also part of the Old Jail. Register House is on the extreme left. North Bridge with a tram car, and Waverley Station in the foreground. The Waverley Market Hall, the low building rising above the glass roof of the station, was fundamentally an empty hall, but used for shows of all kinds, circuses and sometimes dramatic entertainments. Sometimes there were flower beds on the flat roof. Its interior was quite unlike its successor, the Waverley Market, which dates from 1984/85 and consists of shopping mall at different levels ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam and Walker).

Thomson discusses how qualities and skills gained at university can be transferred to students' working lives as well as their roles as good citizens. He discusses the extent to which such transfer is possible, citing the results of psychological experiments of learning.  Thomson discusses the importance of understanding, not only between students of various disciplines, but also between the student and those from other walks of life. He stresses the importance that the specialist be a scholar, rather than merely a repetitive worker, and discusses the conflicting needs of specialism and wider study. The lecture is incomplete.

He goes on to discuss Hotelling's paper on the most predictable criterion in the Journal of Educational Psychology.

The manuscript materialLe Thresor des Divines et Celestes Consolations'(London, 1643) was bound by 'Lord Herbert's Binder'. It contains 21 chapters on the nature and benefits of Afflictions. A rough translation of the introduction gives the flavour: 'Friendly Reader, this book, to which I have given light, shows how tribulations tear us away from sin, which is the source and origin of all pain; it brings us to virtue, to good, and to God, who is the means, the Principle, indeed who is in Himself all the Sovereign good. And afterwards it produces the means to keep always on the right path of virtue, eases our path towards Heaven, and forces us through a secret violence and voluntary constraints, despising that which is of the world (holding its voluptuousness, its delights and vanities against one's will and in disgust) and to breathe towards Heaven, with tears in the eyes, sighs on the lips and sobs in the heart.' The volume is dedicated to Edward Montagu, 2nd. Earl of Manchester (1602-1671), the Presbyterian and a Parliamentary leader. Manchester had succeeded his father as 2nd. Earl of Manchester in November 1642. In August 1643 he was appointed Sergeant-Major-General of the Associated Counties of East Anglia.

This autograph letter signed is dated 10 February 1933, and was written from The Old Rectory, Larling, nr. Norwich. The letter is not addressed to anyone by name and Murry begins by stating that he is 'not perfectly certain of your name even'. It continues by referring to an 'issue between Mrs Carswell and me' which 'is at once simple, and not simple'. Murry states that he does 'not doubt, for one moment, that her original impulse was one of good faith'. He writes, 'She felt it her duty to defend Lawrence against me'. That had been 'her first mistake' one 'made in absolutely good faith, but a mistake of the most serious kind'. Mrs. Carswell 'did not, and does not, understand' his work Son of Woman. He continues by saying that having 'misunderstood' and 'misinterpreted' his work as an attack on Lawrence 'she concluded' that he 'was a sort of devil incarnate'. The letter continues in that vein as he defends his postion to the unnamed correspondent.

Thomson outlines the problems and difficulties in Educational research, and how these can be resolved. These include the difficulty of selecting a representative group (the selection fallacy) and the importance of using suitable control groups in experimental work. Thomson also discusses the difficulty of co-operation with schools, particularly state or public schools, and the need for resources to be dedicated to research.  He expounds upon the usefulness of correlational studies and objective measures in educational research, illustrating his points with examples from studies conducted by international researchers, particularly within the USA.  He discusses how researchers should be trained, stressing the need for them to have a working creed or philosophy of education, and some training in statistical analysis. He also emphasises the need for careful planning and publication of results.

The body of the letter is probably in the hand of a secretary, although the signature itself is thought to be that of Adam Ferguson. The letter dated 16 November 1815, St. Andrews, was written only 3-months or so before his death. The letter is to 'Dear Sir' and bears the address, James Chalmer Esq.r. / Abingdon Street / Westminster / London The letter refers to how on 'the other leaf of this paper' there is 'the original of a letter' which will explain itself. 'How a claim of mine founded upon it has originated is not material'. All he means 'is hereby to empower' James Chalmer 'to receive the contents in my behalf if any such be forthcoming'. He has 'requested the Bankers at Edinburgh to concur in giving' Chalmer 'the same power'. He has no doubt that Coutts (presumably the banking house of Coutts) 'upon the sight of this paper will also concur'. What Ferguson wanted was that 'whatever money should be so obtained may be laid out in the purchase of an Annuity' for his son, Adam Ferguson, 'and in any Fund either publick or private is properly secured for his life'.  The letter does not include 'the other leaf'.

Thomson stresses the need for more investment and energy to be put into vocational education, looking to America as an example.  He emphasises the imbalance of educational investment between the average student versus the above average or the mentally impaired student, arguing that all 3 should receive the same investment, though the methods and curriculum may be different. He proposes the creation of secondary schools equipped for vocational training and apprenticeship, staffed by individuals trained in a trade, but also as teachers, to replace the current evening or day release classes. He gives examples from Germany and Britain of close liaison and co-operation between industry and educators, and cites the Air Training Corps and scheme of National Certificates as existing British foundations to build upon. Thomson argues that whatever education a student receives, it should be grounded in reality and their interests, and thus prepare them for work. He emphasises the need for career guidance for students and good methods of selection into trades, pleading the case that students' abilities and talents be considered throughout their school career rather than from a single test. He also stresses the need for information and individual tests to be made freely available in a centralised place to better facilitate students going into professions and vocations suited to their abilities and interests.

In the first letter dated 25 Jun 1938, Thomson thanks Ledermann for his corrections. He discusses unimodality and bimodality, vectors, and the distributions of loadings, referring to the work of Thurstone and Woodrow, as well as Ledermann's own method for finding the distribution of loadings. He also asks Ledermann if he has heard anything about his Home Office application. In the second later, dated 1 Jul 1938, Thomson asks Ledermann which part of the summer he is to have off, and discusses his analytical expression of the difference between profile correlations and partial correlations for mean score, referring to the work of Kelley and Thurstone.

Thomson begins by emphasising the vital role that school education plays in civilised society. He takes the title of his talk from the H G Wells novel, to which he makes reference. The food of the gods he alludes to is both science and art, and he stresses the importance of both to a balanced civilisation where the two are united by the mastery of language. Thomson praises the school for the opportunities it provides for its pupils and the benefits in turn its pupils provide for their communities.

The copy of the letter is dated 1 April 1882 below the statement that it 'is an exact copy of the copy of the original letter as made by D. Lewis', 1 December 1859.  The original letter was written in London 20 December 1766 by Dr. Benjamin Franklin and was addressed to Dr. Benjamin Rush and Dr. Jonathan Potts. It refers to letters of introduction to several of Franklin's friends in Edinburgh. At the same time he states that 'you will be your own best frtiends if you apply diligently to your studies, refraining from all idle useless amusements'. The letter continues in this vein and then talks of the 'great advantages in going to study at Edinburgh at this time, where there happens to be collected a set of truly great men'.

Thomson outlines the purpose of intelligence testing, referring to his own work in Northumberland in 1919, which was to ensure clever children weren't being passed over for entry into secondary education as a result of their social background. In relation to this, Thomson talks about the benefits of standardisation of intelligence tests, and discusses the problem of coaching and how it can be overcome. Thomson also mentions a child who was tested and subsequently given a place in secondary school, and who wrote to him many years later to let him know he had won the gold medal at the end of his university course.

The Corson Collection consists of materials assembled by James Clarkson Corson (1905-1988), Deputy Librarian of Edinburgh University and Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford.It is comprised of two sub-divisions. The first consists of materials related to Sir Walter Scott, including manuscripts, artworks, realia, memorabilia, press-cuttings, and critical materials, which were purposely collected by Corson to complement his extensive collection of printed works by or about Scott.The second consists of Corson's own papers. Most of these are connected to Corson's published and unpublished research on Sir Walter Scott. There are also, however, papers relating to his role as Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford (1952-1988), some personal and family papers, and the papers of critic and broadcaster William Saunders, for whom Corson appears to have acted as literary executor.

The volume has the armorial book-plate of George Brock M.D. (Georgius Brock M.D.). The text in the volume begins with a quotation from Cullen, so the author of the manuscript was doubtless a follower or student of Cullen whose name is invoked several times subsequently. To begin with the text is concerned with materia medica and the nutritional qualities of foodstuffs. later the text is more various, with topics including physiology and also asphyxiation. A dispute within the Royal College of Physicians is discussed. There are also notes on natural history and geology. At the end of the volume are a few pages of 'original poetry' dated 1821 and in various hands identified by initials.

This collection of 3,465 glass positive slides were acquired from the Roslin Institute in November 2009 as part of a larger accession of material. The slides, which range in date from the 1870s to the 1930s, cover a wide range of subjects; photographs of indigenous peoples from around the world, international travel scenes, personal portraits (frequently of figures connected with the natural/veterinary/agricultural sciences), images and portraits of domestic animals (chiefly sheep, poultry, cows and pigs), illustrations and extracts from books, articles and newspapers. The majority of the slides are black and white, although some are hand-coloured or tinted. Many of the slides were produced by T.J. Walls, an optician on Forrest Road, Edinburgh.  It is thought that at least a proportion of the collection was created or collected by James Cossar Ewart as well as Robert Wallace, in their capacities as professors of, respectively, Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, and were probably used for teaching and illustrative purposes. Both Ewart and Wallace appear (separately) in the slides, as do colleagues and other persons known to both or either of the men. While some of the slides appear to be directly associated with Ewart and/or Wallace, it is supposed that a proportion of the collection may have been sent to them by colleagues from around the world. It is not known how the collection ultimately came to reside at the Roslin Institute.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed from the X-ray pioneer to 'My dear Forbes' on their leaving the Royal High School, placed and dated as Edinburgh (Dalhousie Terrace), 13 March 1889. The letter was written when Spence was 17-years old. He writes, 'In parting with you I part from a friend, and I hope you will not take it as an insult when I say that I have a greater liking for you than I ever had for any of my companions'. He hopes Forbes reached home safely, and he is looking forward to seeing his own parents soon: 'They will leave Constantinople about the first week of April'. He has been up at the school 'paying the V a general visit'. Spence goes on to talk about the forthcoming 'Interscholastic Games at Corstorphine' to be held on 13 April 1889, and how 'Wilson is going in for the long drop at the Interscholastic' and how he 'was thinking of going in for the half mile handicap' at their own School Games to be held on the same day. Additionally, some local historical information is provided in that there is a reference to Jessie King who 'was executed in the Calton Jail on Monday morning. She took things very coolly to the very last', he writes. Although Spence studied Medicine at University, his letter tells of 'doing a little Xenophon every day with the view to going up in October for Greek and Dynamics'.

The letter was written around 3-4 months before his death and is autobiographical. The content is largely reminiscenses about his time at Edinburgh University. He writes, 'There are now so few of my old-time friends surviving that I feel very lonely [and] to hear from any of them is a rare pleasure. Do you know â of my friends of my Univ. days I don't know of any one left!' He goes on to tell about his lodgings in Edinburgh and how he shared with three Orcadians: R.C. Wallace (later Principal of Queen's University, Ontario); J.A. Gunn (later Director of the Nuffield Institute of Medical Research, Oxford); and, Gunn's younger brother J.W.C. Gunn (later Professor of Pharmacology at Cape Town). Apparently the lodgings 'all found were 16 shillings a week'. The small collection also includes some note and letter fragments, and offprints of three articles by Marwick: 'The 'Old Man' in Place-Names', Saga och Sed, (1959); 'An Old Celtic Loan-word in Orkney Place-Names', Namn och Bygd, Vol. 48 (1960); and, review of F.T. Wainwright's 'The Northern Isles', Scottish Studies, Vol. 7, pt 1 (1963).

The collection is composed of: 1 x letter from Professor George Chrystal to the Rt. Hon. The Prime Minister [Herbert Henry Asquith, 1908-1916] from 5 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, 12 June 1911. The letter, in effect turns down the honour of a knighthood 'on the occasion of His Majesty's approaching Coronation'.

      1 x photograph of William Chrystal, Professor Chrystal's father
      1 x portrait photograph, mounted on card, of the wife of Professor Chrystal

Thomson tells Ledermann how glad he would be if, on leaving the University of St Andrews, he would take Lawley's vacated post. He makes him aware of the disadvantages of the post, in particular that it relies on a fund and as such is not permanent, and that would be an unconventional route from which to apply for possible future mathematics lectureships. He also states Emmett's pleasure at the possibility of working with Ledermann.

Thomson advises Ledermann to keep the letters he sends him for future reference. He discusses a paper he has written for the British Journal of Psychology, which regards the influence selection has over factorial analysis, and asks Ledermann if he should shorten it.  He advises Ledermann to make use of some of the concepts for a paper of his own regarding matrix notation, and refers him to work of Hotelling, Thurstone, and Aitken, particularly Aitken's paper, Note on Selection from a Multivariate Normal Population, from Proceedings of Edinburgh Mathematical Society, 1935. Thomson also discusses the possibility of locating a copy of Darmois' Statistique Mathematique, and informs Ledermann of his plans for the next few weeks, which include returning to Edinburgh then possibly staying at Glenapp in Ayrshire.

This undated letter from John Donaldson to H. H. Dibdin, and written from Marchfield, discusses the adjustment and tuning of an organ, and denies that Sir George Clerk had advocated 'the absurd perfect third system' stating, 'Until the valves were equally opened it was quite impossible to know, precisely, what kind of temperament Mr. Hill had adopted for the Music Hall organ. When I tried it with Sir G. Clerk we found one stop in tolerable tune - I say tolerable, but even in that stop many of the octaves were out of tune rendering it impossible to do more than conjecture as to the temperament intended'. Donaldson goes on to suggest that Hill would be the right person to carry out any alterations to the instrument, and comments on attitudes to equal temperament.

The main body of the collection is correspondence from Dr. James D. Macgregor to his family in Scotland (but also to/from others) from both Sierra Leone and the Solomon Islands. The letters are largely in aerogramme form but there are also letters in conventional form with the original stamped and franked envelopes, as well as illustrative postcards and occasional ephemera. The content of the correspondence is largely descriptive of the locations and the work involved there, and to a degree there is family-oriented correspondence. The collection is composed of:    
      Correspondence: c.197 letters from Sierra Leone, 1951-1957;
      Correspondence: c.613 letters from the Solomon Islands, 1957-1975;
      Tour reports to the Chief Secretary of the Western Pacific High Commission, 1960-1964;
      Police Medical/Postmortem Reports to the Sierra Leone Police, c.200 in number;
      Original book-file cover in which the Police Reports had been archived;
      Sierra Leone Protectorate Handbook, 1954.
    
In the material relating to Sierra Leone, 1953, are some programmes for the celebrations to be held at Makeni from 1-3 June 1953 in honour of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. There is also a poster from the 'Committee of Gentlemen' about the staging of a dance on 5 June 1954 to mark the 'forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitri' with music from the 'Famous Cuban Swing Band'. In the material relating to the Solomon Islands, there is a pamphlet about postal information issued by the Orient Line for the vessel SS Oronsay. Many of the early pieces of correspondence are written on Orient Line aerogrammes. An edited version of all Macgregor's letters are contained on a CD within the collection.

In the first letter, dated 6 Sept 1938 and numbered 37 (38), Thomson informs Ledermann of his plans for the next few weeks, which include going to London and to a Carnegie conference in Dinard. He reassures him that he will have an advocate in the Faculty of Science in Edmund Whittaker, and tells him he hopes the decision of the Senate with regards to his DSc will be a positive one. Thomson also asks Ledermann to send his Note on Sampling Distribution to him so he can read it, and remarks that Aitken found it interesting.  In the second letter, dated 11 Sept and numbered 37a (38), Thomson comments on Ledermann's manuscript, telling him he found it interesting, and refers to his use of the term correlational matrices. Thomson advises Ledermann that Biometrika would be a good place to publish, suggesting that Aitken might commend it to Egon Pearson. He informs Ledermann that any offprints can be paid for through the fund.

Lyle has heard much about 'Mr Aitken's abilities, from Glasgow friends', and would regard 'any little assistance' while the 'work is going through the press' to be 'a particular favour'.

Autograph letter signed to the Editor of the Scotsman newspaper, 3 pages 8vo, written at Allerly, Melrose, on writing paper of Edinburgh University, and dated 5 November 1867. The letter, which is either an autograph draft or an edited version prepared for publication, condemns the forgery by Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1880) of letters of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Denis Vrain-Lucas was one of the most notorious forgers of the nineteenth century. His forged letters of Newton and Pascal were sold to one Michel Chasles in 1861. Brewster writes that he is glad to see in the Scotsman the opinions of Professor Kelland and Professor Tait on the letters of Pascal and Newton. The forgery of the letters he writes, 'is proved by every variety of evidence internal, and external, direct and circumstantial, and not a single fact or argument has been produced to prove that they are authentic'.

Thomson discusses the need for education to benefit both the individual and the wider community (or civilisation). He defines intelligence and intelligence testing, and compares the Scottish and English systems to each other and to America. Ultimately, he argues that schools should contain a mixture of intelligence levels, with education catered to each child, which will in turn create a unified society.

In Thomson's letter to Ledermann, dated 19 Jun 1939, he apologises for not replying to an earlier letter of Ledermann's and informs him that he will be happy to send him any of the letters he has written regarding his work from the last year, asking him to specify the subjects he is interested in. In his reply, dated 24 Jun 1939, Ledermann tells Thomson that he would like to look at the problem of maximising and minimizing the specifics, and that he has not managed to progress much with W G Madow's paper on multivariate statistical analysis.
|
Thomson thanks Ledermann for his letter, most likely wishing him a happy seventieth birthday; refers to a song he used to sing to an elderly Strasburg professor; and reflects on an evening he spent with Ledermann ten years previously. Thomson also passes on his best wishes for Ledermann's trip to Israel, and suggests times when they can meet in Manchester the following May.

Thomson outlines the structure of the course and describes what is expected of the students, the value of practical experience, and the difficulties of offering practical experience alongside teaching on a training course. He also discusses the problem of practical experience impinging on written work and study, and how students can manage their time accordingly. Thomson describes the importance of ensuring the knowledge the students have of various classes is brought together, and how important it is that they should not be studied in isolation. He emphasises the importance of understanding key tenets of sociology in relation to education, coming to the course with an open mind, and learning from each other. He also includes a quotation from James Maxwell outlining the function of the Training College in ensuring a synthesis of the students' knowledge takes place.

The lecture largely concerns how selection for university entrance can be made more fair and equal, beginning at the age of eleven with the eleven-plus examination which determines a child's entry into a grammar or a modern school, the latter of which removes the possibility of attending university.  Thomson argues for a mechanism by which pupils wrongly rejected by grammar schools may still enter university. He discusses the influence of industry and character on examination and future success, and the merits of examinations versus teachers' opinions as predictors of future success.  Thomson defends and praises the use of examinations as favourable to nepotism, but discusses how the examination process could be improved upon. He describes a system of school selection used in Saxony, Germany, in 1933, which combined an examination similar in structure and content to an intelligence test, with the schools' opinion of its candidates. He contrasts this to the American state universities, which have a list of affiliated schools which can recommend students to pass into the Freshman year with no examination. Thomson also discusses the use of intelligence tests in selecting candidates for university entrance in order to make a first reduction of the suitable candidates, but stresses this method could not be used on its own for selection. In relation to this, he discusses his specific experiences at Edinburgh University of testing almost the complete entry in 1950 to the faculties of Arts, Science, and Medicine with an Adult Intelligence Test. Also includes a printed flyer for the lecture series.

Manuscript volume of pp.492, in neat hand on narrow folio paper with numerous additional blanks. Item is bound in contemporary half calf, gilt bands, lettered in gilt. The volume begins with a detailed 'Table 1st' and 'Table 2nd'. The 'Table 1st' details the age, occupation, symptoms, and state of the different physical functions (vital, natural, animal, and sexual). The 'Table 2nd' details the necessary information for the taking of daily reports, the effects of medicines, the state of former symptoms, any new symptoms, and the state of primitive functions. The 88 surgical reports follow the comprehensive brief of the tables, recording the name, symptoms, initial treatment and daily progress or decline of patients. One particular report records almost three months of treatment for Betty Campbell who 'suffered a most extensive burn over the back, breasts and neck and superior extremities' after her clothes had caught fire. She died 'in great agony' on 28 January 1827 'having been admitted on November 2nd, 1826'.

The lecture regards the problem of propaganda in school. Thomson defines what he sees as propaganda and its methods, and discusses whether teachers, who have an advantage over their less mature students, can avoid propaganda, and if so, how. He gives a few examples of controversial subjects that should or should not be covered in school. The lecture is on the one side of the manuscript, with the other containing a typescript of an incomplete poem regarding education and scholarship (it is unclear whether this was written by Thomson or copied); and a quotation from Bertrand Russell's Analysis of Matter with Thomson's comments.

Thomson asks Ledermann for his opinion on Thomson first draft of his section of their multivariate paper. He asks for Ledermann's advice on a few areas in particular, listing them and any potential problems he thinks may arise.
|
The lecture comprises of Thomson's advice to new and inexperienced lecturers, and covers topics such as the audibility and clarity of the lecturer; the importance of the lecturer believing in what they are saying; the importance of engaging with the audience; effective use of blackboards, notes, diagrams, examples and models; and the use of humour. Thomson's humour is clear throughout. The advice he offers is actually very unusual for this time â Lawn et all describe it as an innovative step in university teaching, probably about 15 years before the subject began to take hold with the expansion of the universities and the publication of the hale report.

The junction of Potterrow (right) looking approximately north, and Bristo Street (left of print) looking northwest. The street, with its eighteenth century buildings, had close associations with Robert Burns. Potterrow, to the right, was a less important thoroughfare, being narrower. In the centre of the picture, at the 'V' formed by the two streets, is an eighteenth century mansion nicknamed the "Ace of Clubs House" because of its distinctive shape; for many years it was a public house. The site of all this area is now Charles Street Car Park, and the wide Potterrow.

Thomson discusses how intelligence is distributed between the various social or occupational levels of society. He explains the normal distribution of intelligence within the population, drawing parallels with the distribution of height.  Thomson refers to inquiries carried out by him in Northumberland in 1922, and inquiries carried out in the Isle of Wight in 1924, which demonstrated that individual differences outweigh social differences, and supported the notion that heredity plays more part than environment in determining intelligence. He addresses the problem of the differential birth rate, arguing that the best defence against this is mankind's differences, and these should be encouraged by equality in education, allowing secondary schools to be a mixture of abilities and talents opposed to segregation of intelligence.

Thomson informs Ledermann that his article can be printed in Sociometrika or Psychometrika. He is unsure if the former exists and thinks it may be a typing error. Thomson mentions that he has many letters and manuscripts of Ledermann still to acknowledge. These cover topics such as boundary conditions, and Ridley Thomson's criterion. Thomson lists the letters and manuscripts with brief comments. He also discusses the progress of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, briefly outlining a possible structure and referring to work he has consulted including that of E B Wilson, Maxwell Garnett, and Irwin. Thomson finishes the letter by telling Ledermann to have a good holiday.

The notes taken down into this small bound pocket note-book of 131 handwritten pages are believed to have formed part of the Guy's lecture series - 'Elements in the Practice of Physic'. One of the early pages bears the inscription 'John Bethell, Lincoln's Inn Field' but it isn't clear if this was the same individual who took the notes or someone who subsequently owned them. The volume may be particularly important in that the contents significantly pre-date - when compared - the first edition of the published version of Saunders' lectures in 1780. Based upon differing formulations for remedies included in the notes and changes in topics covered, it is believed that the notes may have been taken down circa 1775 or possibly earlier. They are believed to pre-date the manuscript lecture notes held at the Wellcome Library (1780-1782) and the Heritage Library of the Royal College of Physicians (1782). Other Saunders' lecture notes at the Royal College of Surgeons were taken down in 1784, and those at the Royal Society of Medicine dating from 1795. Section headings and formulations for remedies contained in 'Elements in the Practice of Physic' include: Of the Inflammatory Fever; Of the Nervous Fever; Of Intermittent Fevers; Of the Malignant Angina; Of the Inflammation of the Intestines; Of the Rheumatism; Of the Measles; Of the Dropsy; Of Indigestion; Of the Epilepsy; Of the Tetanus; Of Insanity; Of Women During the Time They Are With Child and After Delivery; and, Diseases of Young Children.

Catalogued by Graeme Eddie, converted to this version 14 Sep 2012

Please note that the 2275 items recorded within this catalogue are a combination of those items identified and catalogued between 1985 and 1998 by staff and volunteers at the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower, along with previously uncatalogued material that was also transferred to the University of Edinburgh Special Collections from the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower. The new material was uncovered during the 2016-2020 stock-check undertaken as part of the Wellcome Research Resource-funded archive cataloguing project "Evergreen: Patrick Geddes and the Environment in Equilibrium." All of the items recorded within the printed legacy catlaogue (1998) are listed in the new online catalogue (2020) but there are a significant number of individual items or entire series from the legacy catalogue which were not located during the 2016-2020 stock-check.  The catalogue descriptions for missing items are included in the new online catalogue for the purposes of audit trail and to allow for items to be easily integrated into the collections catalogue should they be rediscovered at a later date.

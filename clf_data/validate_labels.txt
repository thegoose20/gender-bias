Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy hailed from the Kennedy family of Kilmarnock which included Thomas Kennedy c1796-1874, founder of Glenfield & Kennedy (producers of valves) and inventor of the world's first water meter. During the Second World War, Kennedy served with the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), 1942-1945. She was stationed at HMS Pembroke III, the WRNS training depot at Mill Hill in 1942, then at HMS Beaver, Hull, from 1942 to 1943, at HMS Drake, Devonport, in 1943, and then at HMS Pembroke III again and HMS Pembroke V, Bletchley Park, between 1943 and 1945. At Bletchley Park she was working with the team of allied codebreakers who were able to decrypt a vast number of messages that had been enciphered using the German's Enigma machine. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed 'Ultra' by the British, had been a substantial aid to the Allied war effort. In the 1960s and 1970s she was living in London, but by the early 1980s residing in Edinburgh and working at Edinburgh University Library. Kennedy served as an Elder at St. Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh, and lived in the Marchmont district of the city. She had been the inspiration behind the founding of the Rock Trust - a charity for homeless people. Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy died in November 2002 aged 87. In August the following year there was local press coverage of the large fortune of £1.5-million left in her will and which had been inherited from her family.

The University of Malawi opened in 1964-1965 and the academic, poet, writer, journalist, essayist and publisher Professor Steve Bernard Miles Chimombo (b. 1945) had an association with it from 1972 until 2002 when he retired. Chimombo was among the original first known writers from Chancellor College at Zomba near Blantyre, part of the University of Malawi. He was involved in the creative writing magazineOdi. His work includes theNapolo Poemsand the playThe rain-maker. Another early writer at Chancellor College was the poet Jack Mapanje (b. 1944) who had grown up in the newly independent Malawi under the dictatorship of Dr. Hastings Banda. He was a founding member of the Malawi Writers' Group (or Writers Workshop) which was formed in April 1970 in a deliberate attempt to build a Malawian written literature. The Group met weekly at the College and provided its members with a sympathetic audience for their own poems and stories. Through the groups' gatherings they succeeded in avoiding the control of the official government censor. Though the Group was confined to Chancellor College, it attracted contributions from journalists, teachers and businessmen. The Group became the only forum in which Malawian affairs were freely discussed. Mapanje became a Lecturer in English at the College in 1975, and he published his first collection of poems in London in 1981 -Of chameleons and gods. In 1987, by which time he had become Head of the Department of English, he was detained by police acting for Malawi Special Branch and remained in detention at Mikuyu Maximum Security Detention Centre for three and half years without trial. His poems inThe Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison(1993) were composed while he was imprisoned, as well as most of his third collection of poetry,Skipping without Ropes(1998). More recently he taught a degree course at the University of Leeds, 1993-96, in England, and has been teaching as a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle also in England.

Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. Hancock and Beatty continued to collaborate in and correspond about this work after Hancock moved to the University of Bristol. Hancock published 'Comparisons of effects of normal rabbit sera and anti-cock sperm sera on rabbit sperm, including comparison of effects on the sex ratio' in Biology of Reproduction, 18:510-515 (1978).

Thomas Campbell was born on 27 July 1777 in Glasgow where he went to school showing promise as a poet and an interest in Classics. He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Some of these notes refer to Beale's 'metagon' theory, which postulated that certain genes might liberate in the cytoplasm of Paramecia invisible entities called 'metagons' which control the ability of the cell to permit growth of visible endosymbiotic 'mu' (mate-killer) particles. Beale's key paper about the metagon was published in collaboration with Ian Gibson in 1962. Ultimately, however, it had to be abandoned, because Beale was unable to discover any consistent results from later experiments. 'Kappa' and 'Lambda' refer to certain symbionts of Paramecium.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

In 1903 Dr. Arthur Logan Turner (1865-1939) became an Assistant Surgeon at the Ear and Throat Department at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. By 1906, he was a Surgeon, and then in 1921, a Surgeon-Consultant. In 1924, he became Consultant Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary and at Deaconess Hospital in Edinburgh. He was also a Lecturer in Diseases of the Larynx, Ear and Nose at Edinburgh University from 1906 to 1924. It was during this period in Turner's career that the lecture notes in this collection were written by an unknown student.

Robert McCheyne was born in Edinburgh on 21 May 1813. He was educated at the city's Royal High School and then he studied at Edinburgh University, matriculating in 1827. In 1831, he began studies at Divinity Hall and was licensed to preach in 1835. In November 1835 he was appointed as Assistant to the Rev. John Bonar of Larbert and Dunipace, Stirling. He became a well-known preacher and was ordained to St. Peter's Church, Dundee, in November 1836. In 1839 he was part of a committee sent to Palestine by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland to collect information about Jews. McCheyne and Andrew Bonar (d. 1892) recorded their journey in Narrative of a mission of inquiry to the Jews (1842). The Rev. Robert McCheyne died on 25 March 1843, and he was buried by St. Peter's Church, Dundee.

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project – not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a £5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

The work of Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute with patented nuclear transfer technology (which included the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 and Polly, a cloned and transgenic sheep, in 1997) opened out a number of possibilities for scientific and medical research. These included the ability to study genetic diseases more effectively in the most appropriate experimental species, to study the basic mechanisms of ageing, to create genetically identical animals for research use, to facilitate the production of novel proteins in livestock and to modify genes in livestock and other experimental animals. These opportunities led to a number of spin-off ventures from Roslin Institute, intended to exploit the commercial, biotechological and medical possibilities of this technology. In 1997, the Institute granted PPL Therapeutics, itself a company established by Roslin, exclusive license to use nuclear transfer technology for the production of therapeutic and medical nutritional proteins in the milk of genetically modified animals - the Institute retained the rights to the jointly owned arising intellectual propert from ongoing research in agricultural and animal breeding areas. In 1998, Roslin created Roslin Bio-Med, a company formed to exploit the cloning technology developed as part of the research which produced Dolly the sheep. In 1999, Roslin Bio-Med was acquired by Geron Corporation.

Cunningham was born at Crieff, Perth, and educated at the Morrison's Academy, Crieff, and Edinburgh University graduating M.B. in 1874. He was Demonstrator in Anatomy at Edinburgh, 1876-1882, and Professor of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, 1882, at Dublin University, 1883-1903, and at Edinburgh University, 1903-1909. He carried out original research in human and comparative anatomy as well as in the wider field of anthropology including giantism and right-handedness and left-brainedness. He undertook a number of important public duties including service in 1900 with the Royal Commission on the Care of the Sick and the Wounded during the South African War. He was elected FRS in 1891.

John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.

Poet, essayist, literary critic, historian, and social commentator, Christopher Murray Grieve, also known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was born on 11 August 1892 in Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978.

The bibliographer Edward Gordon Duff was born in Liverpool on 16 February 1863. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and then studied at Wadham College, Oxford, from 1883, taking a degree in Classics in 1887. At Oxford he drew up a catalogue of the 15th century books in the Bodleian Library, but further avenues did not open up for him in that direction so in 1889 he began to read for the Bar. In 1893, Duff was appointed by Mrs Rylands as her librarian with the task of cataloguing her books (including the Spencer library), advising on new purchases, organising the collection, and supervising its transfer to the new John Rylands Library in Manchester. He was also Sanders Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge, and President of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society.  Duff's works include Early Printed Books (1893), Early English Printing (1896), The Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476 to 1535 (1906), The English Provincial Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders to 1557 (1912), A Century of the English Book Trade, 1457–1557 (1905), and Fifteenth Century English Books (1917). Edward Gordon Duff died on 28 September 1924.

Janet S.S Blyth studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1918-1921, gaining a BSc in Agricultural Sciences in 1921. In the same year, she became a research student in the Department of Animal Breeding, graduating PhD in 1925. In 1926 she began work as assistant to Alan Greenwood in the section of Research on the Sex Physiology of the Fowl, moving across with him to the Poultry Research Centre after 1947.

James Fleetwood was baptised at Chalfont St. Giles on 25 April 1603. He was educated at Eton and then at King's College, Cambridge. In 1632 he was appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Lichfield. During the Civil War in England, Fleetwood attached himself as Chaplain to the regiment of John, Earl of Rivers, and his contribution during the Battle of Edgehill earned him from King Charles the degree of D.D. from Oxford in November 1642. He was then given the Rectory of Sutton Coldfield but this was later withdrawn from him by Parliament. He was made tutor to Prince Charles, and on the Restoration he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary. He was also given the Rectory of Anstey in Hertfordshire and of Denham in Buckinghamshire. In 1663 and 1667 Fleetwood was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, and on 29 August 1675 he was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester at the Church of St. Peter le Poer, Broad Street, London. James Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester, died on 17 July 1683.

Hamish A. N. McKenzie was educated in Edinburgh. He became an apprentice chartered accountant in 1953 - an apprenticeship which lasted five years. On sitting his finals he began a degree course in English Literature at Dundee University (then part of St. Andrews University), though he transferred to Edinburgh University from which he was awarded the degree of MA (Hons) in 1967. McKenzie then worked for a chartered accountancy firm in Edinburgh, but took the opportunity of becoming a self-employed chartered accountant in 1975/1976. He bought an office in Corstorphine in 1980, employing two persons, and his firm - called McKenzie and Co. - grew gradually. In 1985 the firm moved to Palmerston Place. Hamish McKenzie retired in 1999 and his junior partner continued the business.

Norman Kemp Smith was born in Dundee in 1872. He was educated at Dundee High School and at Harris Academy, Dundee. He studied at the University of St. Andrews and afterward at Jena, Zurich, Berlin, and Paris. He was a Lecturer in Philosophy at Glasgow University from 1897 to 1906 when he went to Princeton, New Jersey, as Professor of Psychology and then, from 1914, as Professor of Philosophy. Between 1916 and 1918, during the First World War, he served with the Department of Information in London. From 1919, Kemp held the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh and occupied the post until his retirement in 1945. He had also taken his share of University administration in varied officies such as Assessor on the University Court and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts. His major published works included output on three 17th and 18th century philosophers, Descartes, Hume, and Kant,Commentary on Kant's critique of pure reason(1918), a translation of Kant'sCritique of pure reason(1929),The philosophy of David Hume(1941), andNew studies in the philosophy of Descartes(1951). Professor Norman Kemp Smith died in Edinburgh on 3 September 1958.

Mary R. E. Ringsleben was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from Aberdeen University in 1956 for her thesis entitled Gavin Douglas: a revaluation. She had been in contact with Scottish writer and poet Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve) concerning her work on Douglas, and he had lauded her work. In another realm entirely, Mary Ringsleben would become an original signatory of the Committee of 100, which was founded on the initiative of Ralph Schoenman and Bertrand Russell in October 1960. This Committee called for a mass movement of civil disobedience against British government policy on nuclear weapons. Its members saw a need for more radical methods than those used by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, especially following the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1959 general election. Based in Leeds, Ringsleben was an organiser of the Northern Direct Action Committee.

On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics.

While it is not clear who wrote these notes of lectures given by Professor David Hume (1757-1838), it is believed that they are either a fair copy made by a student, or copied for sale from the notes of another student. The volume comprises the first twenty-six lectures of Professor Hume given from 12 November 1805 to 27 December 1805. Hume was Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, 1786-1822.

Jay Laurence Lush, the pioneering animal geneticist, was born on 3 January 1896 in Shambaugh, Iowa, United States of America. He studied the B.Sc. course in Animal Husbandry at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University, or KSU), and after obtaining the degree in 1916 he was awarded his M.Sc. at KSU in 1918, and then a Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1922. Between 1930 and 1966, Lush was the Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture at Iowa State University, and he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1967. He was awarded the US National Medal of Science in 1968, and the Wolf Prize in 1979. Lush visited Britain and Australia in 1948 on temporary duty with the US Department of State. Lush's influence on animal breeding around the world has been enhanced greatly by the wide distribution of his work Animal Breeding Plans (1937). In addition, his authoritative mimeographed notes, The genetics of populations (1948), have also played a major role in the thinking of animal breeders. Professor Jay L. Lush died on 22 May 1982.

Thomas Young was probably born in 1725. By the summer of 1751, Young was practicing surgery in Edinburgh. In 1756 he was appointed Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University - only the third holder of that Chair, after Robert Smith and Joseph Gibson, the first holder. Young was the first Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh to actually lecture on the subject of obstetrics. He also had an association with Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary. Professor Thomas Young died 5 February 1783 at the age fifty-seven.

The autobiography was finally published after J J Robertson had made use of Thomson's manuscripts in his lecture, Godfrey Thomson. This generated interest in the material, and after Hector's permission was given, Sir James Duff edited the manuscript, and W B Inglis wrote the last chapter, Edinburgh and Moray House, which Thomson had not managed to finish.

The Scottish zoologist and chief scientist on the 'Challenger' expedition Charles Wyville Thomson was born at Bonsyde in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830. He was the son of a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company, and was baptized Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School and then he studied at Edinburgh University. In 1850 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at Kings College, Aberdeen, and then Professor of Botany at Marischal College, Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a Professor of Natural History in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at the Queen's University of Belfast, and in 1860 was transferred to the Chair of Natural History at the same institution.  In 1868 he assumed the duties of Professor of Botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh University. Wyville Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of dredgings in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS Lightning and HMS Porcupine for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. These researches showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in his work The Depths of the Sea. The results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of HMS Challenger for a global expedition. He was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872. The Challenger Expedition would be deemed a great success, and on his return Wyville Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he was also created a Knight of the Polar Star on a visit to Sweden. Thomson's published work includes The Depths of the Sea (1873) and The Voyage of the Challenger in the Atlantic (1880). Professor Sir Charles Wyville Thomson died at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882.

From the late 1960s until his death in 1975, Yolanda Sonnabend collaborated with the biologist and embryologist C.H. Waddington. She was employed as his research assistant on various projects, and produced the artwork for his book 'Tools for Thought: how to understand and apply the latest scientific techniques of problem solving', which was intended to be a popular guide to new ways of perceiving and understanding the world's scientific, political and ecological problems. Sonnabend's stark and imaginative pen and ink drawings formed the perfect complement to Waddington's ideas, incorporating triangles, graphs, arrows and bird heads, although unfortunately many of her original designs did not make it into the final book, which was finally published two years after Waddington's death.

Sarah Boreland of Dumfries had been instructed 'in the knowledge of the Practice of Midwifery' by Professor James Hamilton and had attended the Edinburgh General Lying-in Hospital. Hamilton considered 'her to be properly qualified for the important duty of midwife'. Boreland may have continued her career later on in Australia. The qualifying certificate issued to Boreland by Professor Hamilton had been discovered in New South Wales. James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senate as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830.  Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or peurperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837). Professor James Hamilton died in November 1839.

William Robinson Pirie was born at the manse of Slains, Aberdeenshire, on 26 July 1804. He studied at University and King's College, Aberdeen, during sessions 1817–21, but did not graduate. He spent some time in a lawyer's office in Aberdeen, but then attended theological classes during sessions 1821–25. He preached in Ellon, Dyce and at Greyfriars' Church in Aberdeen. In 1843 he was appointed Professor of Divinity in Marischal College and University, and in the following year received the honorary degree of D.D., both from Marischal College and from King's College. On the union of the two colleges in 1860 he was assigned the professorship of Divinity and Church History. On the death of Principal Campbell in 1876, Pirie became the resident head of the university, retaining this post until his death. William Robinson Pirie, Professor of Divinity and Principal of the University of Aberdeen, died on 3 November 1885. This letter from Pirie appears to relate to 'Galvanism' and an argument around the subject, or an aspect of it. Galvanism is the contraction of a muscle that is stimulated by an electric current. In physics and chemistry, it is the induction of electrical current from a chemical reaction, typically between two chemicals with differing electronegativities. The effect was named after the scientist Luigi Galvani, who investigated the effect of electricity on dissected animals in the 1780s and 1790s. The modern study of galvanic effects in biology is called electrophysiology, the term galvanism being used only in historical contexts.

The Scottish Musical Society was established in Edinburgh in 1879 at a meeting "of gentlemen present" on 22 October to discuss "Dr Donaldson's scheme for the formation of a Society for Musical Education". The objects of the Society were "to foster, encourage and aid musical ability in the attainment of high vocal or instrumental excellence, and of eminence in musical composition". "Scotland has no means of giving the highest musical education, and Scotland has no resident orchestra". On these two facts was based the necessity for an Association such as the Scottish Musical Society. The Society "will endeavour in every possible way to encourage the study of music and to render the profession of music dignified and honourable". A number of Scottish noblemen became Vice-Presidents of the Society and Professor Sir Herbert Stanley Oakeley, Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh was a Vice-President, ex-officio. The Council of the Society comprised Advocates, Lawyers and Sheriffs, University Professors, Merchants, Manufacturers, Writers and Stockbrokers from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Dundee. The objects of the Society were seen to be of "great national importance" and the Council were confident of "that support which is necessary to render its operations a complete success". The President of the Society, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry and the Chairman of the Council, The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Rosebery, each promised an initial donation of £500, however, this was just a promise and the money never actually changed hands. The ambitions of the Society were to raise £3000, to found an Academy of Music in Edinburgh, to offer a musical education for Scottish students. They were keen to establish an orchestra of local musicians and that pupils from the new Academy would be drafted into it to encourage and train native musicians in the great masterpieces of orchestral music. Sufficient funds were never achieved. In 1887 the suggestion was made that the Society should consider the "advisability of linking themselves and their academy … to the system of musical graduation … in the University of Edinburgh". The opportunity for this link came in 1890 with the proposed reforms in the administration of the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh being reviewed by the Scottish Universities Commission. At a meeting on 10 February 1890, it was resolved that the Society should formulate a scheme for musical education, to be submitted to the commissioners, which would more adequately reflect "the intentions of General Reid and the musical conditions of the time". The Academy of Music for Scotland as envisaged by the founders of the Society never opened and despite attracting interest from across Europe for a conductor for a resident orchestra in Scotland this ambition was overtaken by events and the establishment in 1891 of the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow. In 1900, "having accomplished all that is possible with the means at its disposal" the Society was would up by voluntary liquidation. The committee advised that, "the balance in the hands of the liquidator" be expended in the purchase of books for presentation to the University of Edinburgh for the purposes of the Music Class Room library in connection with the Reid Chair of Music. The three important legacies of the Society were the raising of awareness of the lack of facilities for music education in Scotland, their contributions to the reorganisation of the Reid Chair of Music and the establishment of the Faculty of Music in 1893-94 and the purchase of books and scores for the Reid Music Library, in the University of Edinburgh.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on 6 March 1996.

Hamish Henderson, the folklorist, poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist, was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. Having a gift for languages he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. He served with the Eighth Army - in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. This provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily. After the war, he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002. Michael Sharp was educated at universities in Britain and the United States. His Ph.D is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professor Sharp has taught in Scotland, Greece, Portugal, Nigeria, and at the universities of Binghamton, Harvard, and Wisconsin. He has been a Teaching Fellow in the International School of Theory in the Humanities at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Trained as a Romanticist and in the Literature and Ideas of the nineteenth century, Michael Sharp teaches in the University of Puerto Rico's Department of English where he is active in both the English M.A. and Caribbean PhD programs. His research focuses on the poetry of Anglophone Africa and the Caribbean diaspora. Michael Sharp's poetry has been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Sharp, Michael: "War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson: London Magazine, April/May, 1983  Sharp's publications include War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson which appeared in the 'London magazine', April/May, 1983.

Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

The English poet and radio producer Terence Rogers Tiller was born in Truro, Cornwall, on 9 September 1916. His early career was in medieval history at the University of Cambridge. During the World War II he taught in Cairo, and then in 1946 he joined the BBC. In 1955 he was producer of the first BBC radio adaptation of The lord of the rings. He later brought work by Mervyn Peake to the airwaves. Other BBC projects led to his translations of Piers Plowman and Dante, and the Chess Treasury of the Air (1966) for Penguin, which he edited. As a poet, he was published by Hogarth Press: Poems (1941) and The inward animal (1943). Notes for a myth (1968) and That singing mesh, and other poems (1979) were published by Chatto and Windus in the Phoenix Living Poets series. He also edited New Poems (1960) with Anthony Cronin and Jon Silkin.  Terence Rogers Tiller died on 24 December 1987.  Tiller had also translated A season in hell by Arthur Rimbaud, and Four of a kind by Paul Verlaine.  The French poet Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud was born in Charleville, Ardennes, on 20 October 1854. He produced his works while still in his late teens, Victor Hugo describing him at the time as 'an infant Shakespeare', and he had given up creative writing altogether before the age of 20. As part of the decadent movement, Rimbaud influenced modern literature, music, and arts, and prefigured surrealism. He was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul, traveling extensively on three continents before his death. Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud died from cancer just a few days after his 37th birthday on 10 November 1891. Paul-Marie Verlaine, born in Metz on 30 March 1844, was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the fin de siecle in international and French poetry. He died in Paris on 8 January 1896.

Includes papers collected by Thomson throughout his lifetime, as well as those collected by Hector and Lady Thomson following his death. The former have been organised by Hector and Lady Thomson, who have added notes and annotations in many cases either to assist with Sir James Duff's editing of Thomson's autobiography, or to assist Lady Thomson with her own projected biography of Thomson. The later was never completed, most likely due to Lady Thomson's ill health in her later years.

It is believed that the majority of the moss samples contained in this album were collected in Scotland in the early 19th century. This can be dated from the paper of the album which is watermarked as Robert Weir, Carron (Grove Mill), 1828. The unknown botanist collector has included many fruiting specimens from locations including Tarbolton, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, Newton near Ayr, Dean Castle Kilmarnock, Stair, Craiglockhart, Carrick Hill, Edinburgh College Yard and Dalrymple. Modern notes at the rear of the album suggest that the botanist was working to the classification used in the second edition of Muscologia Britannica (1827) by Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) - father of Joseph Dalton Hooker - and Thomas Taylor (1775-1848).

Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until 1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina Struthers. His publications includeA Concise Dictionary of musical terms(1884),Chopin as a man and musician(1888), andProgramme music in the last four centuries(1907), and Struthers edited hisRobert Schumannfor posthumous publication in 1925. He retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. As an invention which could separate male- and female- determining spermatozoa was potentially of wider commercial interest, a patent was applied for by Beatty to protect this work (known as 'Control of Sex Ratio in Mammalian Offspring') before Hancock submitted his results for publication. In 1976, funding was also received from the Scottish Milk Marketing Board to determine whether the sex-ratio control method could be applicable in cattle. A United States Patent Application was also put forward in 1977.

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

Beale's personal and professional relationship with Tracy Sonneborn began with their first meeting in 1947 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his research group in Indiana University Bloomington, which led to Beale's lifelong interest in Paramecium. Beale remained in contact with Sonneborn for the rest of his life, and authored a biographical memoir of Sonneborn for the Royal Society, published in 1982.

Jonathan Knowles joined Beale's laboratory in 1970 on a Medical Research Centre scholarship for Training and Research Methods. He remained for the next five years and developed techniques for micro-injections of mitochondria into living paramecia. Beale and Knowles also collaborated on a book, Extranuclear Genetics, published by Edward Arnold in 1978.

J. L. Levison lived for a time in Hull, England. He was the author of Mental culture, or, The means of developing the human faculties, published in 1883, and printed for Levison and sold by Jackson and Walford, London, and also of Practical observations on the teeth and gums with the best means for their preservation published in 1838 by Longman, London.  George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788, the son of a brewer. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in the Edinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

Beale's book, Paramecium Genetics and Epigenetics, written collaboratively with John Preer Jr., was published by Routledge, Taylor and Francis in 2008. Chapter 4, eventually titled 'Methods of Studying Genetics Processes in Organisms of the Paramecium aurelia Species Group', discussed, among other things, W. John Haynes' work on gene cloning.

John Webster Lowson Spence was born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) in 1871, the son of a Church of Scotland missionary, the Rev David Brown Spence, who later moved to Constantinople. The younger Spence went to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating in 1898. After an earlier association with Wilhelm Roentgen (discoverer of X-rays, 1895), radiology became his speciality, first as an assistant in the new electrical department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then, from 1907, as head of the electrical and radiological department of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children where he remained for 22 years. Because of the lack of protection available in these early years of working with X-rays - and indeed lack of understanding of the damage that they could do - Spence soon showed signs of illness and damage and between 1910 and 1916 he had to undergo amputations. In 1922 he was awarded a bronze medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund with an annuity of £130 in recognition of his work in radiology. A few years after his death his name was inscribed on a memorial erected in the garden of St. George's Hospital in Hamburg (April 1936) by the German Roentgen Society to honour those X-ray pioneers who had sacrificed their health or their lives in the interests of their work. John Webster Lowson Spence died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1930, aged only 58.

Broadcast by John Baillie, examining the issue of justice and how it relates to Christianity.
|
This autograph letter signed is dated 22 November 1937, and it was written from 'Seamark', Lloyd Road, Hove, Sussex, and addressed to 'My dear Ballie'. The letter regrets that he 'did not see' Baillie last August but that he he will 'have better luck next year'. He has the hope though that he 'will pay me a visit here some day'. The letter accompanied 'this book' - presumably Nicodemus. A mystery (1937). He suggests that if 'you like it at all you may have a chance of suggesting the play for performance'. He believes that in England 'at least' the religious drama 'has a future'. If Baillie is ever to happen to write to him he asks if 'in one word' he might be told 'what people like yourself think of Dunne's Experiment with Time as a proof of Immortality'.

Thomson refers to a proof or article which he had enclosed. This has not survived in the collection. He does not name the author, but suggests to Ledermann that he may want to contact him, either sending the letter by the fastest ship or communicating by cable, charging the costs to the Carnegie fund. He refers to his British Journal of Psychology article discussed previously; highlighting that he wishes it to be understood by less mathematical readers, and encouraging Ledermann to follow it with a more mathematical one.

The letter from E. Gordon Duff is dated Tuesday 7 January 1913, on paper embossed with the arms of the Athenaeum, Liverpool. It is written to 'Dear Mr Johnston' . The letter refers to 'the two books in the Laing portraits'. Apparently the book 'on the table in the sitting portrait was a copy of some Scottish Acts'. The book had been 'sold in the final Laing sale'. When Duff had seen it a couple of months before writing the letter 'it was in the hands of a London firm of booksellers'. Duff goes on to say that the book in the second portrait 'is a MS of the Philobiblon' which 'is now in the University Library Cambridge. The letter was placed inside a copy of Notices of David Laing : to which is added a chronological list of the various publications which were issued under his editorial superintendence from the year M.DCCC.XV. to the year M.DCCC.LXVIII inclusive, by Thomas George Stevenson, 1878, along with a Letter from Harry Gidney Aldis (1863-1919) to Mr. Johnston, with rubbing fragment which is now at E2010.33.

This MS letter, addressed to 'Dear Sir', was written by Violet Jacob at Domaine de la Congue, Vence, in the Alpes Maritimes, France, on 6 April [no year] and presumably in 1936, given the reference in the letter to 'the honour done'. 1936 was the year in which she received the LL.D. from Edinburgh University. Domaine de la Congue is the location of a French 'Maison de retraite', a sanatorium for veterans today. The letter tells of how the letter reached her 'after various adventures' and that there has been a 'delay in answering it'. She continues: 'I cannot say how kind I think it of you to write. You tell me that there are countrymen of mine who will regard the honour done by Edinburgh University as a personal honour to themselves. All the degrees in Europe could not counterbalance that in my eyes'.

Slater and a senior official, W.G Alexander. Also contains correspondence with colleagues at the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation, chiefly Cecil Gordon and C.H Waddington as well as the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Edward Appleton. The papers chiefly concern Sang's details of various grievances within the Organisation and his unhappiness with the conducting of the enquiry and its aftermath. There are also substantial numbers of Sang's drafts of letters (some marked 'Not Sent'), memoranda and notes. Also present are several copies of Sang's 'Memorandum on the affairs of the Genetics Laboratory of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation during the period July 1948 to September 1950'. Later correspondence between Sang and the ARC concerns accommodation and equipment issues in the Poultry Research Centre, and arrangements with Sang's students and colleagues.

Myers refers to the work discussed in the book - the testing of 870 children in Scotland born in Scotland on the 1st of February, May, August, and November 1926, who were given a Binet test and 8 performance tests between 1935-1937.  He thanks Thomson for sending him a copy of the book, and concludes that it was worthwhile work, though the tests were not designed for factor analysis and are not suitable for measuring what he describes as practical intelligence.

No place of origin recorded. 1818-1820 4to., 98 pages (approx. 14,000 words) pen and ink drawings, entirely Holograph neat sloping hand, in contemp. red straight grain morocco, marbled paper sides, light wear.  This Commonplace Book commenced at the very end of 1818 and continued only for a few months gives an interesting indication of the interests of a young woman in her early twenties. The subjects are mostly copied and mostly on topical subjects. They include articles on a variety of subjects including 'The Origin of English Counties', the 'Building of Waterloo Bridge', 'Scientific Subjects', Short Stories, the search for 'Longitude at Sea' etc. There are three articles on Musical Instruments illustrated with pen and ink drawings. viz. 'The Icelandic Instrument Lang-spiel', 'The Clarinet, and The French Horn. The final article on the Races of Persia ends abruptly in mid sentence, shortly after the birth of her son. Unusually, this commonplace book contains articles not normally associated with the readings of a young lady of this period and might well be at least partially influenced by the interests of her husband during the first year or so of their marriage prior to the arrival of their son Herbert.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed to James Nairne, on the death of Lord Eldin, placed and dated as Kensington, London, 12 June 1832. The letter refers to 'The Edinburgh Society of the Sons of the Clergy' and how they 'have done me [mu]ch honor'. Also, at a meeting in London, James Nairne's health was drunk, and his brother 'Capt Nairne' made 'an appropriate reply'. Nairne's announcement of the death of 'our antient friend Lord Eldin' recalls for David Wilkie 'a volume of thoughts. He was the last of his kind, having neither likelihood, nor resemblance to any thing that survives him'. Wilkie goes on to refer to Eldin's 'probable state of affairs' and how this may 'lead to the dispersion, of his pictures' and whether it would 'be wise to send them to London'.

In this lecture, Thomson explores what intelligence is. He discusses the tendency to see intelligence and instinct as separate entities, and why he thinks this is inaccurate; the idea that thinking is simply trial and error using concepts and imagery rather than action; and the correlation between consciousness and intelligence in relation to the flashes of insight that come from the unconscious. He also discusses the work of Spearman, suggesting that Spearman's two factor theory does not adequately represent the complexity of intelligence.

The letter most likely refers to Y Ahmavaara's 1954 article, Transformation analysis of factorial data and other new analytical methods of differential psychology with their application to Thurstone's basic studies, from Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae.  In the letter, Thomson asks Ledermann to check if he is correct in his interpretation of the paper, referring to a chapter on m.v. selection in The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, providing examples and working throughout.

The letter from Christison, 40 Moray Place [ Edinburgh], Monday 4 August [1862], to David Cousin of the City Chambers, refers to a 'long report' read by Dr. Bennett, on the Buildings Committee of the University. The report referred to how 'a careful survey' found the buildings were 'in a condition of great disrepair'. With regard to this, Christison had found, as 'Convenor of Finance', that he had 'a sum of £300' available in the general accounts, and explained that since Dr. Bennett and the 'other members of the Buildings Committee' were in London, and he had been 'suddenly substituted', but had been 'at last floored and in bed' with an illness, he was sure that 'a few minutes of conversation' would enable him to empower Cousin 'to proceed'. The letter then refers to how he had followed the example of his colleagues and had accordingly arranged to leave town for Dumfriesshire from the following Monday and would stay there for ten days.

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

In his letter, dated 3 Mar 1938 and numbered 13 (38), Thomson thanks Ledermann for his previous letter, and responds to his points regarding the reciprocity of persons and tests, referring to Burt's statement that we can always deduce all we want to know about person-factors from an analysis into test-factors, or vice versa, and need only perform whichever analysis is convenient. Thomson disagrees with this, apart from in the case of doubly centred matrices, and illustrates his point with examples throughout. Also includes a postcard, dated 5 Mar 1938 and numbered 13a (38), in which Thomson asks Ledermann to work out a formula using M S Bartlett's principle of minimising the other factors not used.

Johnston's poems are copies of typescript said to have been published in 2000 under the title New joined words, Livingston, West Lothian. There are 53-pages. The works of poetry are dated from 1957, with the poem 'The fish of horror' which was written at Honington, presumably R.A.F. Honington, and tell of a night of over-drinking. There is a poem written in 1966 - 'Good luck boys'. The remainder were written in succeeding decades up to 2001, with the poems 'To the north', 'Guid tae reign for aye!' and 'Symphony for Sydney Ross' being the latest. A few are undated. One of the poems from 2000 is a translation - 'Ken ye the Laun' - from 'Kennst du das Land' by J. W. Goethe. The poems have been numbered in pencil in the order presented by the donor (W.T.Johnston) in plastic sleeves inside a loose-leaf folder. They are now housed in an acid-free folder but maintaining the order as originally presented.

The article explores the uses of intelligence testing in determining mental defects in young children; examinations at 11 (eleven-plus) to determine the child's future schooling; and testing for the purpose of administering vocational guidance. Thomson examines each of these three uses in turn, citing examples of the use of intelligence tests in England and Scotland. He explores some of the problems of testing for selection to secondary school, in particular the possibility of coaching and the need to ensure a steady supply of new, standardised intelligence tests each year. He outlines the standard contents of Moray House Tests and the procedure of trialling the tests to establish their suitability as well as norms within and between age groups. He also touches upon the influence of level of schooling on intelligence test performance, as illustrated by an often negative correlation between age and intelligence within a school year group. Additionally, he describes experiments underway in Fife and London to establish the use of intelligence testing in vocational guidance.

Thomson refers briefly to offprints of Ledermann's Biometrika article. He advises Ledermann not to overwork himself in preparing his lectures at the cost of sleep or original research.

In the first letter, dated 12 Apr 1938 and numbered 21 (38), Thomson tells Ledermann about his trip to Dumfries and the Galloway coast, informing him of his travel plans for the next few weeks which include going to Munich and Vienna. He asks Ledermann to undertake editing work on The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, in particular ensuring a second manuscript is up to date. Thomson also refers to the mathematical appendix he has completed and is sending on to Ledermann to ensure it is correct, and sends good wishes for Ledermann's tour. In the second letter, dated 19 Apr 1938 and numbered 21a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that he has sent the typed manuscripts of the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability to Moray House for him to pick up, and is currently getting the last chapter typed. He also refers to an unnamed cousin of Ledermann who is in some difficulty, and gives Ledermann the name of Sir Philip Hartog, who may be able to help him. Also includes a postcard, dated 21 May 1938 and numbered 21b (38), in which Thomson tells Ledermann briefly about his travels in Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and the professors he met there, and lets him know when he will be in Glenapp.

In Ledermann's letter to Thomson, dated 25 Apr 1939, he informs Thomson of his applying for the Carnegie Teaching Fellowship, which would allow him to undertake original research in the areas of pure matrix algebra and abstract group theory. He also mentions that he would like to devote some time to applied mathematics, specifically factor analysis, and asks Thomson for permission to continue the work he undertook as Thomson's assistant, perhaps with the help of Lawley. In Thomson's reply, dated 26 Apr 1939, he tells Ledermann how pleased he is at the possibility of Ledermann's teaching fellowship and of him continuing work on factor analysis.

The junction of Bristo Street, on the left, and Charles Street, on the right leading to George Square. Bristo Street ran diagonally across Charles Street Car Park from "Bristo Square" (a new development, c1980) to the north end of Chapel Street; it was a main road, now replaced by the new Potterrow. The drysalter's shop on the left was in existence until the demolition of the street c. 1970 (?). "Parker's Corner" on the right shows (c. 1910?) the building as it was before the opening of the drapper's shop with mock Tudor facings, demolished about the same time.

The collection is composed of:    
      This is one of only two examples of Goethe's life-mask. It had been sent to Thomas Carlyle by J. P. Eckermann and hung in Carlyle's home for many years. On Carlyle's death it was presented to David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh, and on his death was given by the Masson family to Professor Hume Brown who in turn bequeathed it to Edinburgh University in 1918.
      Letter dated Weimar 17 June 1913 written by (possibly) Dr. W. Oettingen which indicates the origin of the mask, stating that it is a life-mask rather than a death-mask.
      Letter dated Edinburgh 25 April 1920 from A. Carlyle to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating that there is incertainty as to when 'my Uncle came into possession of the Goethe Mask'.
      Letter dated London 28 April 1920 from Rosaline Masson to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating uncertainty as to how the mask came into Carlyle's possession.

In the first letter, dated 13 Mar 1928 and numbered 17 (38), Thomson discusses the work of M S Bartlett, in particular that the assumptions he makes about each person's ability in the unknown quality e will average zero over a number of persons. He refers to specification equations, and his trouble with them, in particular that they are true for all persons, using Robinson Crusoe as an analogy to show the problems with this premise. Ledermann has made brief marginal notes highlighting passages he agrees or disagrees with. In the second letter, dated 20 Mar 1938 and numbered 17a (38), Thomson states that he was dissatisfied with his previous letter, but having had no time to attend to it he has enclosed it and sent it as it is. He informs Ledermann that he will meet him in London, and encourages Ledermann to stay in London for as long as he wants. He refers briefly to Ledermann's correspondence with Paul Horst, as well as Thurstone's iterative process for finding commonalities.

Peter Baillie ( 1889-1914), youngest brother to John Baillie and Donald Macpherson Baillie, was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and then at George Watson's College. Entering Edinburgh University in 1907, he graduated with a M.B., Ch.B. in 1912. For many years he was a member of the Philomathic Society and became its President in 1911. He was senior house surgeon at Mildmay Mission Hospital, London, for six months and in January 1914 he left Britain for Jalna, India, taking up a post to which he had been appointed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the United Free Church. He was ordained as a missionary elder of Langside Hill United Free Church, Glasgow, prior to his departure. While in India he was the victim of a drowning at Mahableshwar.

Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy hailed from the Kennedy family of Kilmarnock which included Thomas Kennedy c1796-1874, founder of Glenfield & Kennedy (producers of valves) and inventor of the world's first water meter. During the Second World War, Kennedy served with the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), 1942-1945. She was stationed at HMS Pembroke III, the WRNS training depot at Mill Hill in 1942, then at HMS Beaver, Hull, from 1942 to 1943, at HMS Drake, Devonport, in 1943, and then at HMS Pembroke III again and HMS Pembroke V, Bletchley Park, between 1943 and 1945. At Bletchley Park she was working with the team of allied codebreakers who were able to decrypt a vast number of messages that had been enciphered using the German's Enigma machine. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed 'Ultra' by the British, had been a substantial aid to the Allied war effort. In the 1960s and 1970s she was living in London, but by the early 1980s residing in Edinburgh and working at Edinburgh University Library. Kennedy served as an Elder at St. Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh, and lived in the Marchmont district of the city. She had been the inspiration behind the founding of the Rock Trust - a charity for homeless people. Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy died in November 2002 aged 87. In August the following year there was local press coverage of the large fortune of £1.5-million left in her will and which had been inherited from her family.

Herbert Mather Spoor, a Yorkshireman, but latterly from Rochester, in Kent, was a Captain with the 77th Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery (a heavy artillery group). He attended Edinburgh University in the 1900s as a medical student and is believed to have been the founder of the University Cycling Club. While at the University he took a number of photographs showing life on campus, including some of members of the E.U. Cycling Club when they were out-and-about around the city. Spoor was awarded the degrees of M.B., Ch.B.Ed. from Edinburgh University in 1908 and became registered as a doctor on 18 December 1908. He practiced in Stoke, Rochester, at the practice of Trubridge, Coombe and Spoor. He was Superintendent at the local Hoo St. Werburgh Isolation Hospital. He was also a member of the British Medical Association and wrote for the Lancet in 1909. In 1918 Capt. Herbert Mather Spoor R.A.M.C. was posthumously awarded the Military Cross for 'conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty'. He was killed at the age of 45 on 13 December 1917, and is buried at Ypres Reservoir Cemetery, in Ieper (Ypres), Belgium.

The University of Malawi opened in 1964-1965 and the academic, poet, writer, journalist, essayist and publisher Professor Steve Bernard Miles Chimombo (b. 1945) had an association with it from 1972 until 2002 when he retired. Chimombo was among the original first known writers from Chancellor College at Zomba near Blantyre, part of the University of Malawi. He was involved in the creative writing magazineOdi. His work includes theNapolo Poemsand the playThe rain-maker. Another early writer at Chancellor College was the poet Jack Mapanje (b. 1944) who had grown up in the newly independent Malawi under the dictatorship of Dr. Hastings Banda. He was a founding member of the Malawi Writers' Group (or Writers Workshop) which was formed in April 1970 in a deliberate attempt to build a Malawian written literature. The Group met weekly at the College and provided its members with a sympathetic audience for their own poems and stories. Through the groups' gatherings they succeeded in avoiding the control of the official government censor. Though the Group was confined to Chancellor College, it attracted contributions from journalists, teachers and businessmen. The Group became the only forum in which Malawian affairs were freely discussed. Mapanje became a Lecturer in English at the College in 1975, and he published his first collection of poems in London in 1981 -Of chameleons and gods. In 1987, by which time he had become Head of the Department of English, he was detained by police acting for Malawi Special Branch and remained in detention at Mikuyu Maximum Security Detention Centre for three and half years without trial. His poems inThe Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison(1993) were composed while he was imprisoned, as well as most of his third collection of poetry,Skipping without Ropes(1998). More recently he taught a degree course at the University of Leeds, 1993-96, in England, and has been teaching as a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle also in England.

Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

The geographer Professor Thomas Walter Freeman was born on 27 December 1908 in Congleton, Cheshire. Between 1922 and 1926 Freeman attended grammar schools in Nantwich, Cheshire and at Bridgend, South Wales. In 1927 he entered the University of Leeds and in 1930 graduated with a first-class honours degree in geography, followed in 1931 by a Diploma of Education. He served as a Lecturer in the Geography Department of Edinburgh University, 1933-1936, and in 1934 he assumed some editorial responsibilities for the Scottish Geographical Magazine. Freeman then moved to Trinity College, Dublin, where he initiated an honours course in geography and began research on Irish population patterns. During the Second World War, between 1941 and 1945 he worked part-time at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge as assistant to P. M. Roxby, who was preparing Admiralty handbooks on China. In 1950 Freeman became Reader in Geography at Manchester University - and then Professor in 1974 - and he remained at Manchester until his retirement in 1976. His publications included Ireland: a Regional Geography  (1950), Geography and Planning (1958), The Conurbations of Great Britain (1959), and Geography and Regional Administration (1968). Professor Thomas Walter Freeman died on 11 March 1988

From 1919-1927 John Baillie was Richards Professor of Christian Theology at Auburn Theological Seminary, New York. During this time his correspondants included his brother Donald Macpherson Baillie, Henry Sloane Coffin, Frederick Carlos Ferry, Jacob Gould Schurman, Hugh Ross Mackintosh (including correspondence about the vacancy at Auburn) and David Smith Cairns.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. Hancock and Beatty continued to collaborate in and correspond about this work after Hancock moved to the University of Bristol. Hancock published 'Comparisons of effects of normal rabbit sera and anti-cock sperm sera on rabbit sperm, including comparison of effects on the sex ratio' in Biology of Reproduction, 18:510-515 (1978).

Thomas Campbell was born on 27 July 1777 in Glasgow where he went to school showing promise as a poet and an interest in Classics. He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Beale was awarded a five-year programme grant by the Medical Research Council in 1972 for research on the genetics of malaria parasites. The research involved carrying out work on rodent malaria parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium vinckei, with the aim of improving an understanding of the basic biology of the human malaria parasite.
|
Beale's interest in Russia stemmed from the Second World War, when he was in the Intelligence Corps (Field Security) Army Base Unit convoy posted in Archangel in 1941. Beale had some Russian already and was fluent by the time he returned. He kept up a correspondence with various Russian scientists throughout his lifetime, and retained an interest in the fate of science during the Soviet Union, particularly the career of Soviet biologist and agronomist Trofim Lysenko.

Robert Henry Thouless was born on 14 July 1894. He was educated at the City of Norwich School and he studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degree of B.A. in Natural Sciences in 1915. During the Great War he served in the Royal Engineers with the British Salonika Force and after the interruption of the War he was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from Cambridge in 1922. In 1921 Thouless was appointed Lecturer in Pyschology at Manchester University, then in 1926 he was Lecturer at Glasgow University, and then back to Cambridge as a Lecturer in 1938. At Cambridge he became Reader in Educational Psychology in 1945, and from 1961 he was Reader Emeritus there. In 1962 and in 1966 Thouless was lecturing in Australia. He was a Consultant for the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) in 1964, President of the British Psychological Society in 1949, President of the Society for Psychical Research in 1942, President of Section J (Psychology) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1937. Thouless's publications spanned across six decades and includedAn introduction to the psychology of religion(1923),Straight and crooked thinking(1930),Straight thinking in war time(1942),Authority and freedom(1954),Experimental psychical research(1963), andMissing the message(1971). Latterly Robert Henry Thouless had lived in Cambridge, and he died on 25 September 1984.

The doctor and anaesthetist writer Samuel William Carruthers was born on 7 February 1866 in Islington, London. In 1883, while in his 6th Form at Dulwich College, he was awarded a Royal Geographical Society Prize Medal. He studied at Edinburgh University obtaining the degrees of M.B., C.M. on 1 August 1889, and then the M.D. on 29 July 1899 having written 'A contribution to the mechanism of articulate speech'. His doctoral piece was 'deemed worthy of competing for Gold Medals'. In 1888 he had read a dissertation on aphasia before the Royal Medical Society in Edinburgh. While at University too he was Secretary of the Rectorial Association and in 1887 he seconded the nomination of the Marquis of Lothian for the Lord Rectorship in succession to Lord Iddesleigh. Carruthers was registered as a doctor on 17 October 1889, in Scotland. Prior to the award of his M.D., in 1896 he had married Emily Hopkins Haldeman (1864-1932). During the First World War he treated many of the refugees from Belgium without charge. He had practiced medicine in Norwood and retired at the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout that war however, he served as an anaesthetist at Norwood Cottage Hospital Carruthers had also been a writer and historian, and Latin and Greek scholar, and had been Elder of the Presbyterian Church. Towards the end of his life he learned Danish in order to translate the British Medical Journal for Denmark. Dr. Samuel William Carruthers died on 6 April 1962 at Norwood Cottage Hospital, Norwood, London.

Some of these notes refer to Beale's 'metagon' theory, which postulated that certain genes might liberate in the cytoplasm of Paramecia invisible entities called 'metagons' which control the ability of the cell to permit growth of visible endosymbiotic 'mu' (mate-killer) particles. Beale's key paper about the metagon was published in collaboration with Ian Gibson in 1962. Ultimately, however, it had to be abandoned, because Beale was unable to discover any consistent results from later experiments. 'Kappa' and 'Lambda' refer to certain symbionts of Paramecium.

Florence Jewel Fowler was born in 1893, at Erdington, near Birmingham, the daughter of Richard Fowler, land agent & surveyor, and his wife Florence Pearse. During the First World War, she was a volunteer with the British Expeditionary Force in France, where she met John Baillie and, after the end of the war, they married at Leamington Spa. Jewel took an active interest in her husband's work, accompanying when he travelled, sitting on charitable committees, looking after missionary furlough houses and much more. She also wrote a preface to his Baptism and Conversion and a foreward to his A Reasoned Faith.

The philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson was born at Logierait, Perthshire, on 20 June 1723. He was educated at home, locally in Logierait, and in Perth. He studied at St. Andrews University, taking his M.A. in July 1742. Studies in divinity followed, first at St. Andrews, then at Edinburgh University. An army career followed, and then he embarked on a literary career. Briefly Ferguson held the post of Librarian at the Advocates' Library in succession to David Hume (1711-1776). In 1759 he was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University, and in 1764 to the Chair of the now obsolete Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy. In 1778, he was appointed as Secretary to the Commissioners to the American Colonies. Ferguson retired from the Chair of Moral Philosophy in 1785, but so that he could still draw a salary he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

William Hunter was born on 1 June 1861 in Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast. He was educated at Ayr Academy, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1883 with M.B., C.M. (1st Class) 1883, and M.D. (Gold Medal) 1886. He served as a house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and as a Physican to the Western Dispensary, Edinburgh. He had also studied overseas at Leipzig in 1884 with a grant from the BMA, and during the period 1887-1890 he visited Vienna and Strasbourg. Also during 1887-1890 he worked full time on laboratory research at Cambridge, devoting himself to pernicious anaemia. From 1895, Hunter was affiliated with the Charing Cross Hospital and the London Fever Hospital. Earlier, in 1894, he married Beatrice Fielden, daughter of Joshua Fielden MP. He was the first person to note that the alimentary and the nervous system were often affected in pernicious anaemia, and he regarded the haemolytic element as being most important and made numerous observations on the excessive pigmentation and iron deposition in the liver. Hunter, along with Julius Otto Ludwig Moeller, is associated with 'Hunter's glossitis' caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency ('Moeller-Hunter glossitis'), and he is also associated with the 'Serbian barrel' used for disinfection and the eradication of lice during the First World War in Serbia. During the First World War, Hunter served in Serbia with the British Military Sanitary Mission where he developed de-lousing techniques to control typhus. He was appointed as a Grand Officer of the Serbian Order of St. Sava in June 1915. In December 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches and was awarded the Companion Order of the Bath (CB). He was President of the Advisory Committee, Prevention of Disease, in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia (Gallipoli, Egypt, Salonika, Malta and Palestine), and he served with the Eastern Command, 1917-1919, as Consulting Physician. He held the rank of Colonel. Hunter's published work includesOral sepsis as a cause of 'Septic gastritis', 'Toxic neuritis' and other septic conditions(1901),Pernicious anaemia: its pathology, septic origin, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Based upon original investigations(1901),A research into epidemic and epizootic plague(1904),Severest anaemias. Their infective nature, diagnosis and treatment(1909),Historical account of Charing Cross hospital and medical school (University of London): original plan and statutes, rise and progress(1914), andThe Serbian epidemics of typhus and relapsing fever in 1915(1920). He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP London 1896) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and he was awarded an Honorary LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1927. William Hunter died on 13 January 1937.

Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In 1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890

Rev Thomas Allan was born on 16 August 1916 in Newmilnes, Ayrshire to William and Agnes. He was educated at Newmilnes Primary School and Kilmarnock Academy before going on to graduate from the University of Glasgow with a first class honours degree in English Literature. In 1945, following a number of years war service in the RAF he entered Trinity Theological College, Glasgow and was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1946.
In 1941 Tom Allan married Jane Moore and they had three children, Margaret Elizabeth, William Thomas and Kenneth John.
Rev Tom Allan's first charge was North Kelvinside Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1953 when he left to join the "Tell Scotland" movement. Tell Scotland started as a result of two Scottish radio missions of the BBC in which leading preachers of several denominations combined in a nation wide evangelistic drive. In 1953 the "Tell Scotland" committee was formed and Rev Tom Allan was appointed evangelistic organiser. He became a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century and travelled extensively throughout Britain in his capacity as evangelist for the Church of Scotland. In 1955 when Billy Graham held his 'All Scotland Crusade', Tom Allan was Chairman of the organizing committee.
In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project – not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a £5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

The work of Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute with patented nuclear transfer technology (which included the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 and Polly, a cloned and transgenic sheep, in 1997) opened out a number of possibilities for scientific and medical research. These included the ability to study genetic diseases more effectively in the most appropriate experimental species, to study the basic mechanisms of ageing, to create genetically identical animals for research use, to facilitate the production of novel proteins in livestock and to modify genes in livestock and other experimental animals. These opportunities led to a number of spin-off ventures from Roslin Institute, intended to exploit the commercial, biotechological and medical possibilities of this technology. In 1997, the Institute granted PPL Therapeutics, itself a company established by Roslin, exclusive license to use nuclear transfer technology for the production of therapeutic and medical nutritional proteins in the milk of genetically modified animals - the Institute retained the rights to the jointly owned arising intellectual propert from ongoing research in agricultural and animal breeding areas. In 1998, Roslin created Roslin Bio-Med, a company formed to exploit the cloning technology developed as part of the research which produced Dolly the sheep. In 1999, Roslin Bio-Med was acquired by Geron Corporation.

John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.

Poet, essayist, literary critic, historian, and social commentator, Christopher Murray Grieve, also known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was born on 11 August 1892 in Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978.

The bibliographer Edward Gordon Duff was born in Liverpool on 16 February 1863. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and then studied at Wadham College, Oxford, from 1883, taking a degree in Classics in 1887. At Oxford he drew up a catalogue of the 15th century books in the Bodleian Library, but further avenues did not open up for him in that direction so in 1889 he began to read for the Bar. In 1893, Duff was appointed by Mrs Rylands as her librarian with the task of cataloguing her books (including the Spencer library), advising on new purchases, organising the collection, and supervising its transfer to the new John Rylands Library in Manchester. He was also Sanders Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge, and President of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society.  Duff's works include Early Printed Books (1893), Early English Printing (1896), The Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476 to 1535 (1906), The English Provincial Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders to 1557 (1912), A Century of the English Book Trade, 1457–1557 (1905), and Fifteenth Century English Books (1917). Edward Gordon Duff died on 28 September 1924.

James Fleetwood was baptised at Chalfont St. Giles on 25 April 1603. He was educated at Eton and then at King's College, Cambridge. In 1632 he was appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Lichfield. During the Civil War in England, Fleetwood attached himself as Chaplain to the regiment of John, Earl of Rivers, and his contribution during the Battle of Edgehill earned him from King Charles the degree of D.D. from Oxford in November 1642. He was then given the Rectory of Sutton Coldfield but this was later withdrawn from him by Parliament. He was made tutor to Prince Charles, and on the Restoration he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary. He was also given the Rectory of Anstey in Hertfordshire and of Denham in Buckinghamshire. In 1663 and 1667 Fleetwood was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, and on 29 August 1675 he was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester at the Church of St. Peter le Poer, Broad Street, London. James Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester, died on 17 July 1683.

Hamish A. N. McKenzie was educated in Edinburgh. He became an apprentice chartered accountant in 1953 - an apprenticeship which lasted five years. On sitting his finals he began a degree course in English Literature at Dundee University (then part of St. Andrews University), though he transferred to Edinburgh University from which he was awarded the degree of MA (Hons) in 1967. McKenzie then worked for a chartered accountancy firm in Edinburgh, but took the opportunity of becoming a self-employed chartered accountant in 1975/1976. He bought an office in Corstorphine in 1980, employing two persons, and his firm - called McKenzie and Co. - grew gradually. In 1985 the firm moved to Palmerston Place. Hamish McKenzie retired in 1999 and his junior partner continued the business.

Mary R. E. Ringsleben was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from Aberdeen University in 1956 for her thesis entitled Gavin Douglas: a revaluation. She had been in contact with Scottish writer and poet Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve) concerning her work on Douglas, and he had lauded her work. In another realm entirely, Mary Ringsleben would become an original signatory of the Committee of 100, which was founded on the initiative of Ralph Schoenman and Bertrand Russell in October 1960. This Committee called for a mass movement of civil disobedience against British government policy on nuclear weapons. Its members saw a need for more radical methods than those used by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, especially following the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1959 general election. Based in Leeds, Ringsleben was an organiser of the Northern Direct Action Committee.

On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics.

While it is not clear who wrote these notes of lectures given by Professor David Hume (1757-1838), it is believed that they are either a fair copy made by a student, or copied for sale from the notes of another student. The volume comprises the first twenty-six lectures of Professor Hume given from 12 November 1805 to 27 December 1805. Hume was Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, 1786-1822.

Jay Laurence Lush, the pioneering animal geneticist, was born on 3 January 1896 in Shambaugh, Iowa, United States of America. He studied the B.Sc. course in Animal Husbandry at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University, or KSU), and after obtaining the degree in 1916 he was awarded his M.Sc. at KSU in 1918, and then a Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1922. Between 1930 and 1966, Lush was the Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture at Iowa State University, and he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1967. He was awarded the US National Medal of Science in 1968, and the Wolf Prize in 1979. Lush visited Britain and Australia in 1948 on temporary duty with the US Department of State. Lush's influence on animal breeding around the world has been enhanced greatly by the wide distribution of his work Animal Breeding Plans (1937). In addition, his authoritative mimeographed notes, The genetics of populations (1948), have also played a major role in the thinking of animal breeders. Professor Jay L. Lush died on 22 May 1982.

Thomas Young was probably born in 1725. By the summer of 1751, Young was practicing surgery in Edinburgh. In 1756 he was appointed Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University - only the third holder of that Chair, after Robert Smith and Joseph Gibson, the first holder. Young was the first Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh to actually lecture on the subject of obstetrics. He also had an association with Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary. Professor Thomas Young died 5 February 1783 at the age fifty-seven.

The Scottish zoologist and chief scientist on the 'Challenger' expedition Charles Wyville Thomson was born at Bonsyde in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830. He was the son of a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company, and was baptized Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School and then he studied at Edinburgh University. In 1850 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at Kings College, Aberdeen, and then Professor of Botany at Marischal College, Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a Professor of Natural History in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at the Queen's University of Belfast, and in 1860 was transferred to the Chair of Natural History at the same institution.  In 1868 he assumed the duties of Professor of Botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh University. Wyville Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of dredgings in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS Lightning and HMS Porcupine for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. These researches showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in his work The Depths of the Sea. The results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of HMS Challenger for a global expedition. He was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872. The Challenger Expedition would be deemed a great success, and on his return Wyville Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he was also created a Knight of the Polar Star on a visit to Sweden. Thomson's published work includes The Depths of the Sea (1873) and The Voyage of the Challenger in the Atlantic (1880). Professor Sir Charles Wyville Thomson died at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882.

James S. K. Elmslie, the son of a butcher, became qualified as a Veterinary Surgeon in Edinburgh in 1934 having studied at the then Royal (Dick) Veterinary College in the city. His career was closely involved with meat hygiene and public health and in the late-1930s he was in Birkenhead and Holyhead inspecting imported Irish cattle. In February-March 1960 Elmslie took part in a British government vist to Kenya along with Mr. A. D. J. Brennan to determine the possibilities for the import of Kenyan beef into the UK.

From the late 1960s until his death in 1975, Yolanda Sonnabend collaborated with the biologist and embryologist C.H. Waddington. She was employed as his research assistant on various projects, and produced the artwork for his book 'Tools for Thought: how to understand and apply the latest scientific techniques of problem solving', which was intended to be a popular guide to new ways of perceiving and understanding the world's scientific, political and ecological problems. Sonnabend's stark and imaginative pen and ink drawings formed the perfect complement to Waddington's ideas, incorporating triangles, graphs, arrows and bird heads, although unfortunately many of her original designs did not make it into the final book, which was finally published two years after Waddington's death.

Sarah Boreland of Dumfries had been instructed 'in the knowledge of the Practice of Midwifery' by Professor James Hamilton and had attended the Edinburgh General Lying-in Hospital. Hamilton considered 'her to be properly qualified for the important duty of midwife'. Boreland may have continued her career later on in Australia. The qualifying certificate issued to Boreland by Professor Hamilton had been discovered in New South Wales. James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senate as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830.  Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or peurperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837). Professor James Hamilton died in November 1839.

The Scottish poet and novelist George Mann MacBeth was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, on 19 January 1932. When he was three, his family moved to Sheffield and he was educated at King Edward VII School in the city, before studying at New College, Oxford, with an Open Scholarship in Classics.  On graduating from Oxford, he joined BBC Radio in 1955, working as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the BBC Third Programme, until 1976. He would then resign from the BBC to take up novel writing, and he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury. After a divorce from his first wife, he married the novelist Lisa St Aubin de Terán (b. 1953), and then after a second divorce, he moved with his third wife to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, dying with this in 1992. His work spans four decades and includes: A Form of Words (1954); the editing of the Penguin Book of Sick Verse (1963), and of the Penguin Book of Animal Verse (1965), and the Penguin Book of Victorian Verse (1969); Missile Commander (1965); Shrapnel (1972); the thriller The Samurai (1976); the thriller Cadbury and the Samurai  (1981); The Long Darkness (1984); Trespassing. Poems from Ireland (1991); and, the novel The Testament of Spencer (1992). In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. His Poems from Oby (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society. Macbeth received a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for his work.  George Mann Macbeth died in Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland on 13 February 1992.

John Archibald Watt Dollar, born in 1866, was a member of the equine veterinary practice T. A. Dollar and Sons, Veterinary Surgeons, New Bond Street, London. His father, the founder of the practice, was Thomas Aitken Dollar (1833-1909). The elder Dollar studied at the then Edinburgh Veterinary College and was awarded the Highland and Agricultural Society's certificate in 1851. In 1880, he was Vice-President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. By the time Dollar died on 26 September 1909, the veterinary practice was the largest in London with a presence (veterinary forges) in Baker Street, in Westminster, in Blackfriars, in Lambeth, in Belgrave Square, in Chelsea, and in Paddington. The practice also had paddocks at Wells House Farm, East Acton During the 1880s, John Archibald Watt Dollar and his older brother William Watt Dollar (1860-1938) joined their father's veterinary business, though the younger Dollar spent much of his time travelling abroad and visiting veterinary colleges. John was credited with introducing the first equine operating table to Britain - the table had been designed by himself. He published too and his works include: a translation ofMoeller's operative veterinary surgery(1894), then with Albert Wheatley and othersA handbook of horse-shoeing with introductory chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot(1898), then with Gustave Moussu,Diseases of cattle, sheep, goats and swine(1905), and with Heinrich Moeller, theRegional Veterinary Surgery and Operative Technique (incorporating Prof. Dr. H. Moeller's 'Veterinary Surgery'.)(1912), andDollar's Veterinary surgery : general, operative, and regionalwhich went to a 4th edition in 1950. John A. W. Dollar was Warden of the Worshipful Company of Farriers from 1900 to 1903, and was President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, circa 1904-1905. On the death of their father in 1909, the two brothers continued to work together at the practice which moved to Baker Street in 1919. They retired in 1926 however, and the practice was sold to a Mr. Tay. John Archibald Watt Dollar died in 1947.

George Baillie was born on 16 March 1664. He was the son of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood and, through his mother Rachel, grandson of Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston, Edinburgh, Lord Warriston in the Cromwellian Parliament.Baillie's father was executed in 1684 on a charge of complicity in the Rye House plot, and after the execution the younger Baillie fled to Holland with his father's political associate, Sir Patrick Hume, who later became the 1st Earl of Marchmont. When William of Orange ascended the throne, Baillie returned to Scotland and played a prominent role as a leader of the Squadrone, whose votes gave the Act of Union a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Earlier, in September 1691 he married Grisell, the daughter of Sir Patrick Hume.He served in the Scottish Parliament as MP for Berwickshire, 1693-1698, and 1700-1701, and MP for Lanarkshire 1703-1707. Then in the British Parliament he served as a Lord Commissioner of Trade, 1710-1712, as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, 1714-1717, and as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, 1717-1725.Between May 1731 and October 1733, Baillie spent time in Italy with his wife. In 1734 he stood down from his Parliamentary career, and on 6 August 1738 he died.

William Robinson Pirie was born at the manse of Slains, Aberdeenshire, on 26 July 1804. He studied at University and King's College, Aberdeen, during sessions 1817–21, but did not graduate. He spent some time in a lawyer's office in Aberdeen, but then attended theological classes during sessions 1821–25. He preached in Ellon, Dyce and at Greyfriars' Church in Aberdeen. In 1843 he was appointed Professor of Divinity in Marischal College and University, and in the following year received the honorary degree of D.D., both from Marischal College and from King's College. On the union of the two colleges in 1860 he was assigned the professorship of Divinity and Church History. On the death of Principal Campbell in 1876, Pirie became the resident head of the university, retaining this post until his death. William Robinson Pirie, Professor of Divinity and Principal of the University of Aberdeen, died on 3 November 1885. This letter from Pirie appears to relate to 'Galvanism' and an argument around the subject, or an aspect of it. Galvanism is the contraction of a muscle that is stimulated by an electric current. In physics and chemistry, it is the induction of electrical current from a chemical reaction, typically between two chemicals with differing electronegativities. The effect was named after the scientist Luigi Galvani, who investigated the effect of electricity on dissected animals in the 1780s and 1790s. The modern study of galvanic effects in biology is called electrophysiology, the term galvanism being used only in historical contexts.

The Scottish Musical Society was established in Edinburgh in 1879 at a meeting "of gentlemen present" on 22 October to discuss "Dr Donaldson's scheme for the formation of a Society for Musical Education". The objects of the Society were "to foster, encourage and aid musical ability in the attainment of high vocal or instrumental excellence, and of eminence in musical composition". "Scotland has no means of giving the highest musical education, and Scotland has no resident orchestra". On these two facts was based the necessity for an Association such as the Scottish Musical Society. The Society "will endeavour in every possible way to encourage the study of music and to render the profession of music dignified and honourable". A number of Scottish noblemen became Vice-Presidents of the Society and Professor Sir Herbert Stanley Oakeley, Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh was a Vice-President, ex-officio. The Council of the Society comprised Advocates, Lawyers and Sheriffs, University Professors, Merchants, Manufacturers, Writers and Stockbrokers from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Dundee. The objects of the Society were seen to be of "great national importance" and the Council were confident of "that support which is necessary to render its operations a complete success". The President of the Society, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry and the Chairman of the Council, The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Rosebery, each promised an initial donation of £500, however, this was just a promise and the money never actually changed hands. The ambitions of the Society were to raise £3000, to found an Academy of Music in Edinburgh, to offer a musical education for Scottish students. They were keen to establish an orchestra of local musicians and that pupils from the new Academy would be drafted into it to encourage and train native musicians in the great masterpieces of orchestral music. Sufficient funds were never achieved. In 1887 the suggestion was made that the Society should consider the "advisability of linking themselves and their academy … to the system of musical graduation … in the University of Edinburgh". The opportunity for this link came in 1890 with the proposed reforms in the administration of the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh being reviewed by the Scottish Universities Commission. At a meeting on 10 February 1890, it was resolved that the Society should formulate a scheme for musical education, to be submitted to the commissioners, which would more adequately reflect "the intentions of General Reid and the musical conditions of the time". The Academy of Music for Scotland as envisaged by the founders of the Society never opened and despite attracting interest from across Europe for a conductor for a resident orchestra in Scotland this ambition was overtaken by events and the establishment in 1891 of the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow. In 1900, "having accomplished all that is possible with the means at its disposal" the Society was would up by voluntary liquidation. The committee advised that, "the balance in the hands of the liquidator" be expended in the purchase of books for presentation to the University of Edinburgh for the purposes of the Music Class Room library in connection with the Reid Chair of Music. The three important legacies of the Society were the raising of awareness of the lack of facilities for music education in Scotland, their contributions to the reorganisation of the Reid Chair of Music and the establishment of the Faculty of Music in 1893-94 and the purchase of books and scores for the Reid Music Library, in the University of Edinburgh.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on 6 March 1996.

Hamish Henderson, the folklorist, poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist, was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. Having a gift for languages he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. He served with the Eighth Army - in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. This provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily. After the war, he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002. Michael Sharp was educated at universities in Britain and the United States. His Ph.D is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professor Sharp has taught in Scotland, Greece, Portugal, Nigeria, and at the universities of Binghamton, Harvard, and Wisconsin. He has been a Teaching Fellow in the International School of Theory in the Humanities at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Trained as a Romanticist and in the Literature and Ideas of the nineteenth century, Michael Sharp teaches in the University of Puerto Rico's Department of English where he is active in both the English M.A. and Caribbean PhD programs. His research focuses on the poetry of Anglophone Africa and the Caribbean diaspora. Michael Sharp's poetry has been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Sharp, Michael: "War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson: London Magazine, April/May, 1983  Sharp's publications include War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson which appeared in the 'London magazine', April/May, 1983.

Ian M. L. Hunter graduated from Edinburgh University in 1950 with a First Class Honours degree in Psychology (B.Sc), and also graduated from Oxford in 1953 with a D.Phil. Between 1953 and 1962 he was a Lecturer in Psychology at Edinburgh University. In 1962 he went to the University of Keele as its foundation Professor of Psychology. He retired early from Keele in 1982, then became Emeritus Professor. In the early 1960s, while Dr. Ian M.L. Hunter, he collaborated with Professor Alexander C. Aitken in investigations about his extraordinary abilities as a mental calculator. They met frequently and also exchanged letters. Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912, and then studied at the University of Otago from 1913. His studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry in Gallipoli and Egypt. Wounded during the Battle of the Somme, Aitken returned to New Zealand in 1917, after hospitalisation. He gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967, and Ian M.L. Hunter, Emeritus Professor of Psychology at Keele University, died in Edinburgh on 30 August 2004.

David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

The English poet and radio producer Terence Rogers Tiller was born in Truro, Cornwall, on 9 September 1916. His early career was in medieval history at the University of Cambridge. During the World War II he taught in Cairo, and then in 1946 he joined the BBC. In 1955 he was producer of the first BBC radio adaptation of The lord of the rings. He later brought work by Mervyn Peake to the airwaves. Other BBC projects led to his translations of Piers Plowman and Dante, and the Chess Treasury of the Air (1966) for Penguin, which he edited. As a poet, he was published by Hogarth Press: Poems (1941) and The inward animal (1943). Notes for a myth (1968) and That singing mesh, and other poems (1979) were published by Chatto and Windus in the Phoenix Living Poets series. He also edited New Poems (1960) with Anthony Cronin and Jon Silkin.  Terence Rogers Tiller died on 24 December 1987.  Tiller had also translated A season in hell by Arthur Rimbaud, and Four of a kind by Paul Verlaine.  The French poet Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud was born in Charleville, Ardennes, on 20 October 1854. He produced his works while still in his late teens, Victor Hugo describing him at the time as 'an infant Shakespeare', and he had given up creative writing altogether before the age of 20. As part of the decadent movement, Rimbaud influenced modern literature, music, and arts, and prefigured surrealism. He was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul, traveling extensively on three continents before his death. Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud died from cancer just a few days after his 37th birthday on 10 November 1891. Paul-Marie Verlaine, born in Metz on 30 March 1844, was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the fin de siecle in international and French poetry. He died in Paris on 8 January 1896.

Includes papers collected by Thomson throughout his lifetime, as well as those collected by Hector and Lady Thomson following his death. The former have been organised by Hector and Lady Thomson, who have added notes and annotations in many cases either to assist with Sir James Duff's editing of Thomson's autobiography, or to assist Lady Thomson with her own projected biography of Thomson. The later was never completed, most likely due to Lady Thomson's ill health in her later years.

It is believed that the majority of the moss samples contained in this album were collected in Scotland in the early 19th century. This can be dated from the paper of the album which is watermarked as Robert Weir, Carron (Grove Mill), 1828. The unknown botanist collector has included many fruiting specimens from locations including Tarbolton, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, Newton near Ayr, Dean Castle Kilmarnock, Stair, Craiglockhart, Carrick Hill, Edinburgh College Yard and Dalrymple. Modern notes at the rear of the album suggest that the botanist was working to the classification used in the second edition of Muscologia Britannica (1827) by Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) - father of Joseph Dalton Hooker - and Thomas Taylor (1775-1848).

Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until 1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina Struthers. His publications includeA Concise Dictionary of musical terms(1884),Chopin as a man and musician(1888), andProgramme music in the last four centuries(1907), and Struthers edited hisRobert Schumannfor posthumous publication in 1925. He retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. As an invention which could separate male- and female- determining spermatozoa was potentially of wider commercial interest, a patent was applied for by Beatty to protect this work (known as 'Control of Sex Ratio in Mammalian Offspring') before Hancock submitted his results for publication. In 1976, funding was also received from the Scottish Milk Marketing Board to determine whether the sex-ratio control method could be applicable in cattle. A United States Patent Application was also put forward in 1977.

Richard Albert Lewis was from Smethwick, in the English Midlands. He was born in 1915. He studied history at the University of Birmingham, earning the degrees of B.A. and Ph.D. Lewis served in the Ordnance Corps and later the Education Corps during the Second World War, ending up in India just prior to partition in 1947.

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

Beale's personal and professional relationship with Tracy Sonneborn began with their first meeting in 1947 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his research group in Indiana University Bloomington, which led to Beale's lifelong interest in Paramecium. Beale remained in contact with Sonneborn for the rest of his life, and authored a biographical memoir of Sonneborn for the Royal Society, published in 1982.

Jonathan Knowles joined Beale's laboratory in 1970 on a Medical Research Centre scholarship for Training and Research Methods. He remained for the next five years and developed techniques for micro-injections of mitochondria into living paramecia. Beale and Knowles also collaborated on a book, Extranuclear Genetics, published by Edward Arnold in 1978.

J. L. Levison lived for a time in Hull, England. He was the author of Mental culture, or, The means of developing the human faculties, published in 1883, and printed for Levison and sold by Jackson and Walford, London, and also of Practical observations on the teeth and gums with the best means for their preservation published in 1838 by Longman, London.  George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788, the son of a brewer. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in the Edinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

John Webster Lowson Spence was born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) in 1871, the son of a Church of Scotland missionary, the Rev David Brown Spence, who later moved to Constantinople. The younger Spence went to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating in 1898. After an earlier association with Wilhelm Roentgen (discoverer of X-rays, 1895), radiology became his speciality, first as an assistant in the new electrical department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then, from 1907, as head of the electrical and radiological department of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children where he remained for 22 years. Because of the lack of protection available in these early years of working with X-rays - and indeed lack of understanding of the damage that they could do - Spence soon showed signs of illness and damage and between 1910 and 1916 he had to undergo amputations. In 1922 he was awarded a bronze medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund with an annuity of £130 in recognition of his work in radiology. A few years after his death his name was inscribed on a memorial erected in the garden of St. George's Hospital in Hamburg (April 1936) by the German Roentgen Society to honour those X-ray pioneers who had sacrificed their health or their lives in the interests of their work. John Webster Lowson Spence died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1930, aged only 58.

Broadcast by John Baillie, examining the issue of justice and how it relates to Christianity.
|
This autograph letter signed is dated 22 November 1937, and it was written from 'Seamark', Lloyd Road, Hove, Sussex, and addressed to 'My dear Ballie'. The letter regrets that he 'did not see' Baillie last August but that he he will 'have better luck next year'. He has the hope though that he 'will pay me a visit here some day'. The letter accompanied 'this book' - presumably Nicodemus. A mystery (1937). He suggests that if 'you like it at all you may have a chance of suggesting the play for performance'. He believes that in England 'at least' the religious drama 'has a future'. If Baillie is ever to happen to write to him he asks if 'in one word' he might be told 'what people like yourself think of Dunne's Experiment with Time as a proof of Immortality'.

Thomson refers to a proof or article which he had enclosed. This has not survived in the collection.

He refers to his British Journal of Psychology article discussed previously; highlighting that he wishes it to be understood by less mathematical readers, and encouraging Ledermann to follow it with a more mathematical one.

The letter from E. Gordon Duff is dated Tuesday 7 January 1913, on paper embossed with the arms of the Athenaeum, Liverpool. It is written to 'Dear Mr Johnston' . The letter refers to 'the two books in the Laing portraits'. Apparently the book 'on the table in the sitting portrait was a copy of some Scottish Acts'. The book had been 'sold in the final Laing sale'. When Duff had seen it a couple of months before writing the letter 'it was in the hands of a London firm of booksellers'. Duff goes on to say that the book in the second portrait 'is a MS of the Philobiblon' which 'is now in the University Library Cambridge. The letter was placed inside a copy of Notices of David Laing : to which is added a chronological list of the various publications which were issued under his editorial superintendence from the year M.DCCC.XV. to the year M.DCCC.LXVIII inclusive, by Thomas George Stevenson, 1878, along with a Letter from Harry Gidney Aldis (1863-1919) to Mr. Johnston, with rubbing fragment which is now at E2010.33.

This MS letter, addressed to 'Dear Sir', was written by Violet Jacob at Domaine de la Congue, Vence, in the Alpes Maritimes, France, on 6 April [no year] and presumably in 1936, given the reference in the letter to 'the honour done'. 1936 was the year in which she received the LL.D. from Edinburgh University. Domaine de la Congue is the location of a French 'Maison de retraite', a sanatorium for veterans today. The letter tells of how the letter reached her 'after various adventures' and that there has been a 'delay in answering it'. She continues: 'I cannot say how kind I think it of you to write. You tell me that there are countrymen of mine who will regard the honour done by Edinburgh University as a personal honour to themselves. All the degrees in Europe could not counterbalance that in my eyes'.

Contains chiefly correspondence between Sang and individuals within the Agricultural Research Council (ARC); namely the chairman, Lord Victor Rothschild, the secretary, Sir William K. Slater and a senior official, W.G Alexander. Also contains correspondence with colleagues at the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation, chiefly Cecil Gordon and C.H Waddington as well as the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Edward Appleton. The papers chiefly concern Sang's details of various grievances within the Organisation and his unhappiness with the conducting of the enquiry and its aftermath. There are also substantial numbers of Sang's drafts of letters (some marked 'Not Sent'), memoranda and notes. Also present are several copies of Sang's 'Memorandum on the affairs of the Genetics Laboratory of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation during the period July 1948 to September 1950'. Later correspondence between Sang and the ARC concerns accommodation and equipment issues in the Poultry Research Centre, and arrangements with Sang's students and colleagues.

Myers refers to the work discussed in the book - the testing of 870 children in Scotland born in Scotland on the 1st of February, May, August, and November 1926, who were given a Binet test and 8 performance tests between 1935-1937.  He thanks Thomson for sending him a copy of the book, and concludes that it was worthwhile work, though the tests were not designed for factor analysis and are not suitable for measuring what he describes as practical intelligence.

No place of origin recorded. 1818-1820 4to., 98 pages (approx. 14,000 words) pen and ink drawings, entirely Holograph neat sloping hand, in contemp. red straight grain morocco, marbled paper sides, light wear.  This Commonplace Book commenced at the very end of 1818 and continued only for a few months gives an interesting indication of the interests of a young woman in her early twenties. The subjects are mostly copied and mostly on topical subjects. They include articles on a variety of subjects including 'The Origin of English Counties', the 'Building of Waterloo Bridge', 'Scientific Subjects', Short Stories, the search for 'Longitude at Sea' etc. There are three articles on Musical Instruments illustrated with pen and ink drawings. viz. 'The Icelandic Instrument Lang-spiel', 'The Clarinet, and The French Horn. The final article on the Races of Persia ends abruptly in mid sentence, shortly after the birth of her son. Unusually, this commonplace book contains articles not normally associated with the readings of a young lady of this period and might well be at least partially influenced by the interests of her husband during the first year or so of their marriage prior to the arrival of their son Herbert.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed to James Nairne, on the death of Lord Eldin, placed and dated as Kensington, London, 12 June 1832. The letter refers to 'The Edinburgh Society of the Sons of the Clergy' and how they 'have done me [mu]ch honor'. Also, at a meeting in London, James Nairne's health was drunk, and his brother 'Capt Nairne' made 'an appropriate reply'. Nairne's announcement of the death of 'our antient friend Lord Eldin' recalls for David Wilkie 'a volume of thoughts. He was the last of his kind, having neither likelihood, nor resemblance to any thing that survives him'. Wilkie goes on to refer to Eldin's 'probable state of affairs' and how this may 'lead to the dispersion, of his pictures' and whether it would 'be wise to send them to London'.

In this lecture, Thomson explores what intelligence is. He discusses the tendency to see intelligence and instinct as separate entities, and why he thinks this is inaccurate; the idea that thinking is simply trial and error using concepts and imagery rather than action; and the correlation between consciousness and intelligence in relation to the flashes of insight that come from the unconscious. He also discusses the work of Spearman, suggesting that Spearman's two factor theory does not adequately represent the complexity of intelligence.

The letter from Christison, 40 Moray Place [ Edinburgh], Monday 4 August [1862], to David Cousin of the City Chambers, refers to a 'long report' read by Dr. Bennett, on the Buildings Committee of the University. The report referred to how 'a careful survey' found the buildings were 'in a condition of great disrepair'. With regard to this, Christison had found, as 'Convenor of Finance', that he had 'a sum of £300' available in the general accounts, and explained that since Dr. Bennett and the 'other members of the Buildings Committee' were in London, and he had been 'suddenly substituted', but had been 'at last floored and in bed' with an illness, he was sure that 'a few minutes of conversation' would enable him to empower Cousin 'to proceed'. The letter then refers to how he had followed the example of his colleagues and had accordingly arranged to leave town for Dumfriesshire from the following Monday and would stay there for ten days.

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

This key research resource is an important survival, being a manuscript account book detailing transactions - debits and credits - relating to the lead-ore company at Leadhills, operated by Sir John Hope of Craighall. Many important people are mentioned in this book, including Alexander Hope of London, Archibald Hope of Craighall, the Earl of Wigtown, the Duke of Hamilton, the Lord of Inglestone, Charles Erskine of Alba, Alexander Tait, Lady Marie Keith, the Earl of Crawford, Lord Mordington, Lord Cardcross, and Alexander Ross. The amounts involved are huge, with the account of revenues in hand running to over £70,000 towards the end of the period. The manuscript volume itself is composed of a short alphabetic table of names, then from folio 1, accounts dating from 1 August 1662, Edinburgh, to 7 September 1671, Edinburgh, at folio 221. Towards the rear of the volume are another set of accounts and revenues and interests on 87 folios.

In his letter, dated 3 Mar 1938 and numbered 13 (38), Thomson thanks Ledermann for his previous letter, and responds to his points regarding the reciprocity of persons and tests, referring to Burt's statement that we can always deduce all we want to know about person-factors from an analysis into test-factors, or vice versa, and need only perform whichever analysis is convenient. Thomson disagrees with this, apart from in the case of doubly centred matrices, and illustrates his point with examples throughout. Also includes a postcard, dated 5 Mar 1938 and numbered 13a (38), in which Thomson asks Ledermann to work out a formula using M S Bartlett's principle of minimising the other factors not used.

The article explores the uses of intelligence testing in determining mental defects in young children; examinations at 11 (eleven-plus) to determine the child's future schooling; and testing for the purpose of administering vocational guidance. Thomson examines each of these three uses in turn, citing examples of the use of intelligence tests in England and Scotland. He explores some of the problems of testing for selection to secondary school, in particular the possibility of coaching and the need to ensure a steady supply of new, standardised intelligence tests each year. He outlines the standard contents of Moray House Tests and the procedure of trialling the tests to establish their suitability as well as norms within and between age groups. He also touches upon the influence of level of schooling on intelligence test performance, as illustrated by an often negative correlation between age and intelligence within a school year group. Additionally, he describes experiments underway in Fife and London to establish the use of intelligence testing in vocational guidance.

Thomson refers briefly to offprints of Ledermann's Biometrika article. He advises Ledermann not to overwork himself in preparing his lectures at the cost of sleep or original research.

In the first letter, dated 12 Apr 1938 and numbered 21 (38), Thomson tells Ledermann about his trip to Dumfries and the Galloway coast, informing him of his travel plans for the next few weeks which include going to Munich and Vienna. He asks Ledermann to undertake editing work on The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, in particular ensuring a second manuscript is up to date. Thomson also refers to the mathematical appendix he has completed and is sending on to Ledermann to ensure it is correct, and sends good wishes for Ledermann's tour. In the second letter, dated 19 Apr 1938 and numbered 21a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that he has sent the typed manuscripts of the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability to Moray House for him to pick up, and is currently getting the last chapter typed. He also refers to an unnamed cousin of Ledermann who is in some difficulty, and gives Ledermann the name of Sir Philip Hartog, who may be able to help him. Also includes a postcard, dated 21 May 1938 and numbered 21b (38), in which Thomson tells Ledermann briefly about his travels in Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and the professors he met there, and lets him know when he will be in Glenapp.

The junction of Bristo Street, on the left, and Charles Street, on the right leading to George Square. Bristo Street ran diagonally across Charles Street Car Park from "Bristo Square" (a new development, c1980) to the north end of Chapel Street; it was a main road, now replaced by the new Potterrow. The drysalter's shop on the left was in existence until the demolition of the street c. 1970 (?). "Parker's Corner" on the right shows (c. 1910?) the building as it was before the opening of the drapper's shop with mock Tudor facings, demolished about the same time.

      This is one of only two examples of Goethe's life-mask. It had been sent to Thomas Carlyle by J. P. Eckermann and hung in Carlyle's home for many years. On Carlyle's death it was presented to David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh, and on his death was given by the Masson family to Professor Hume Brown who in turn bequeathed it to Edinburgh University in 1918.
      Letter dated Weimar 17 June 1913 written by (possibly) Dr. W. Oettingen which indicates the origin of the mask, stating that it is a life-mask rather than a death-mask.
      Letter dated Edinburgh 25 April 1920 from A. Carlyle to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating that there is incertainty as to when 'my Uncle came into possession of the Goethe Mask'.
      Letter dated London 28 April 1920 from Rosaline Masson to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating uncertainty as to how the mask came into Carlyle's possession.

In the first letter, dated 13 Mar 1928 and numbered 17 (38), Thomson discusses the work of M S Bartlett, in particular that the assumptions he makes about each person's ability in the unknown quality e will average zero over a number of persons. He refers to specification equations, and his trouble with them, in particular that they are true for all persons, using Robinson Crusoe as an analogy to show the problems with this premise. Ledermann has made brief marginal notes highlighting passages he agrees or disagrees with. In the second letter, dated 20 Mar 1938 and numbered 17a (38), Thomson states that he was dissatisfied with his previous letter, but having had no time to attend to it he has enclosed it and sent it as it is. He informs Ledermann that he will meet him in London, and encourages Ledermann to stay in London for as long as he wants. He refers briefly to Ledermann's correspondence with Paul Horst, as well as Thurstone's iterative process for finding commonalities.

The collection is composed of:    
      MS memorandum (pp.11) titled Field conveyance for the sick and wounded signed J. S. Login, and dated 30 June 1857, Castle Menzies, Perthshire. The document outlines Login's idea and the approaches made to the War Office and the subsequent bureaucratic referrals. The War Office subsequently undertook the manufacture of a 'blessiere' to the design for testing purposes. Login refers to the parade where the first Victoria Crosses were awarded and notes the sufferings of the wounded soldiers who were badly jolted in their hospital litters in the march-past.
      Letter from the War Department, to 'Sir John Logan / Roehampton', dated 9 April 1855, informing him that Lord Panmure has indicated 'that two Blessieres have been constructed' according to his design 'and that they are now ready for inspection'.
      Letter from the Royal Carriage Department, Woolwich, to 'Sir John Logan / Roehampton', dated 28 April 1855, informing him of 'the formation of a Committee of Officers for the consideration of Hospital Conveyances' and that a meeting will take place on 2 may [1855].
      Memorandum on the nature of litters for the use of the army in the Crimea and the different ways they could be used in the field - e.g. on wagons, on gun limbers - and their possible adaption for shipboard use.
      Letter (copy) from Login, to the military Carriage Office, dated 9 May 1855, Roehampton, and concerning the prototype litters.
      Bill from Messers. Lenny and Co., Coach Builders and Harness Makers, dated 2 May 1855 onwards, for the construction of the litters at a totasl cost of £25 / 12 shillings.

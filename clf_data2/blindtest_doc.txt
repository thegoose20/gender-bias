The neurophysiologist Ewart Geoffrey Walsh was born in Cheltenham on 25 November 1922. He attended grammar school in the town after which a scholarship took him to Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied Medicine. He graduated with the degree of B.A., with First Class Honours in Animal Physiology in 1943. He then spent two years as a Rockefeller student at Harvard, gaining an M.D., before returning to Oxford to graduate M.A., B.Sc., B.M. BCh. in 1947. He qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) in 1950, and the following year, in a move away from clinical medicine, he arrived at the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in the Department of Physiology. Until his elevation to Senior Lecturer in 1957, he also served as a part-time electro-encephalographer at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and thereafter, from 1957, an honorary consultant clinical neurophysiologist. In 1959, Walsh became a Fellow of the Royal Society (Edinburgh), and in 1963-1964 he was a W.H.O. Visiting Professor at Baroda Medical College, India. In 1967 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (London), and in 1968 a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh). From 1967 until 1990 he was Reader at the Department of Physiology, at Edinburgh.  Walsh collaborated widely and his work had a considerable influence on human neurophysiology and some of his work on tremor is still cited. In addition to numerous original papers, his publications were: The physiology of the nervous system (1957, and 1964); and, Muscles, masses and motion: the physiology of normality, hypotonicity, spasticity and rigidity (1992). He was an active member of the Physiological Society, serving on its committee from 1983 to 1986, and he had earlier served on the editorial board of the Journal of Physiology between 1965 and 1972. He also served on editorial board of Paraplegia from 1985 to 1991. In 1991, he became Honorary Neurophysiological Specialist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and from 1997 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Central England, Birmingham. Dr. Ewart Geoffrey Walsh died on 26 March 2003.

In the first letter, dated 12 Apr 1938 and numbered 21 (38), Thomson tells Ledermann about his trip to Dumfries and the Galloway coast, informing him of his travel plans for the next few weeks which include going to Munich and Vienna. He asks Ledermann to undertake editing work on The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, in particular ensuring a second manuscript is up to date. Thomson also refers to the mathematical appendix he has completed and is sending on to Ledermann to ensure it is correct, and sends good wishes for Ledermann's tour. In the second letter, dated 19 Apr 1938 and numbered 21a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that he has sent the typed manuscripts of the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability to Moray House for him to pick up, and is currently getting the last chapter typed. He also refers to an unnamed cousin of Ledermann who is in some difficulty, and gives Ledermann the name of Sir Philip Hartog, who may be able to help him. Also includes a postcard, dated 21 May 1938 and numbered 21b (38), in which Thomson tells Ledermann briefly about his travels in Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and the professors he met there, and lets him know when he will be in Glenapp.

Henry Stewart Noel McFarland was born in Perth on 25 December 1924. He attended the Western District school in Perth between 1929 and 1936 and then went to the Central Secondary, Aberdeen, from 1936 until 1942, where he was advised to leave his studies due to his very bad eyesight. McFarland never heeded this advice, and studied for the degree of MA in Aberdeen, graduating with honours in English Language and Literature in July 1946.  McFarland then came to Edinburgh to study Education, where he was a student of Godfrey H Thomson's, and graduated from Moray House with the Dip.Ed in July 1947. He was then a member of the Thomson B.Ed group in 1948, graduating in July 1948. Having become a close friend of Thomson, who recognised his talents and capabilities, McFarland joined him in a project on University teaching and learning.  Initially, McFarland had been proposed by Thomson for a post in the Schools Inspectorate, which he didn't get because he was too young. McFarland worked for Thomson for about three years, from 1949 until 1951. It is possible that Thomson was intending to develop university entrance tests, through his Moray House 'brand'; tests like these had been used in the US since 1901, first as an achievement test and then, by the 1920s, as an aptitude or intelligence test, but they were not used in the UK.  McFarland published several books and articles, as well as contributing to the Hale Report, which is regarded as one of the foundations of the study of university teaching methods. McFarland was a lecturer in the Education department St Andrews University until 1966, when he accepted the post of Professor of Education at the University of Durham. He passed away suddenly in 1973, aged 48.

In 1812, Napoleon had invaded Russia with the aim of forcing Tsar Alexander I to remain in the Continental System and to remove a threatened Russian invasion of Poland. His Grand Army crossed the River Niemen in June 1812 and the Battle of Borodino followed in September 1812 ending in a tactical defeat for the Russians and the opening of the road to Moscow for Napoleon. By 14 September, Moscow had been captured but the Russians had largely abandoned the city. The Tsar refused to capitulate and the city Governor ordered the burning of Moscow. Without a clear victory, Napoleon began the retreat from Moscow and a return to Paris. In the Moscow Campaign, Napoleon had lost 380,000 men and another 100,000 had been captured, and seeing an opportunity, Prussia, Sweden, Austria and a number of German States re-entered the war. Major battles in Germany in 1813 included Luetzen and Bautzen in May 1813, Dresden in August 1813, and the Battle of Leipzig (the Battle of the Nations) in October 1813. Napoleon would subsequently lose the French Campaign in 1814, and go into exile on Elba briefly before being defeated finally at Waterloo in 1815. The description of events near Sottrum, North Germany - between Ottersberg and Rotenburg, just to the southwest of Hamburg - which is the focus of the material of this collection, can be read in the context of events in Germany at the time, and just prior to the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The description appears to have been written 50 years after the event and tells of the rout of between six thousand and eight thousand French troops by a handful of Hamburg volunteers and cossacks.

Frederick Sleigh Roberts was the second son of General Sir Abraham Roberts, G.C.B. (1784-1873). He was born at Kanpur (then Cawnpore), India, on the 30 September 1832. Roberts was educated at Eton, Sandhurst and Addiscombe, and he obtained a commission in the Bengal Artillery on 12 December 1851. In the following year he was posted to a field battery at Peshawar, where he also acted as aide-de-camp to his father, who commanded the Peshawar division. Roberts was an outstanding combat leader in the Second Afghan War (1878-80) and the South African War (1899-1902). He became Commander-in-Chief in India (1885-1893), and was the last Commander-in-Chief of the British Army (1901-04) before the office was abolished. He had been made a Field-Marshal in 1895. Foreseeing World War I, he was one of the earliest advocates of compulsory military service. Roberts had first distinguished himself during the suppression of the Indian Mutiny (1857-58). On September 1, 1880, he scored the decisive victory of the Second Afghan War, defeating Ayub Khan's Afghan Army near Kandahar. In the South African War, he ended a succession of British defeats, and captured Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State Republic on 13 March 1900. He then annexed the state as the Orange River Colony in May 1900, and took the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria. He gave way to Horatio Herbert Kitchener as Commander-in-Chief in South Africa in November 1900. Roberts was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in December 1858 for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj, India. He was created a Baron in 1892 and an Earl and Viscount in 1901. Field-Marshal The Rt Hon. The Earl Roberts VC KG KP GCB OM GCSI GCIE PC died from pneumonia at Saint-Omer, France, on 14 November 1914. The Field-Marshal was one of only two non-Royal persons to lie-in-state in Westminster Hall during the 20th century (the other was Sir Winston Churchill). He was given a State Funeral.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed to James Nairne, on the death of Lord Eldin, placed and dated as Kensington, London, 12 June 1832. The letter refers to 'The Edinburgh Society of the Sons of the Clergy' and how they 'have done me [mu]ch honor'. Also, at a meeting in London, James Nairne's health was drunk, and his brother 'Capt Nairne' made 'an appropriate reply'. Nairne's announcement of the death of 'our antient friend Lord Eldin' recalls for David Wilkie 'a volume of thoughts. He was the last of his kind, having neither likelihood, nor resemblance to any thing that survives him'. Wilkie goes on to refer to Eldin's 'probable state of affairs' and how this may 'lead to the dispersion, of his pictures' and whether it would 'be wise to send them to London'.

Robert G. Edwards studied in Beatty's research group in the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics and received his PhD in 1955. The correspondence here, however, covers the period when Edwards was based in Cambridge as a Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology and, in collaboration with Patrick Steptoe, was conducting work on fertilising human eggs in a laboratory. This work on in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which in 1978 would lead to the birth of the first 'test-tube baby', gained Edwards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010, but at the time led to much hostility, opposition and legal controversy.

Hamish A. N. McKenzie was educated in Edinburgh. He became an apprentice chartered accountant in 1953 - an apprenticeship which lasted five years. On sitting his finals he began a degree course in English Literature at Dundee University (then part of St. Andrews University), though he transferred to Edinburgh University from which he was awarded the degree of MA (Hons) in 1967. McKenzie then worked for a chartered accountancy firm in Edinburgh, but took the opportunity of becoming a self-employed chartered accountant in 1975/1976. He bought an office in Corstorphine in 1980, employing two persons, and his firm - called McKenzie and Co. - grew gradually. In 1985 the firm moved to Palmerston Place. Hamish McKenzie retired in 1999 and his junior partner continued the business.

This is a manuscript common-place book of original lyric verse, from c. 1827-1839, and with numerous pen and ink drawings and watercolours. The poems are mostly of a sentimental religious nature, distinctly rural, and with a few of a topical nature. Topical lines include an opening poem on Napoleon, the death of Canning, the death of the opera-singer Maria Malibran, and one on the accession of Queen Victoria. Some are family orientated and include watercolour portraits - 'Letitia. On her return from Bath 21 Dec. 1837' and 'On Ben's birth day, 12 November 1837'. There is a poem entitled 'Crypt Bells' referring to Gloucester's 'Cloister'd scenes', which together with the reference to Bath may offer a clue to the location of the unknown writer.

The Scottish Musical Society was established in Edinburgh in 1879 at a meeting "of gentlemen present" on 22 October to discuss "Dr Donaldson's scheme for the formation of a Society for Musical Education". The objects of the Society were "to foster, encourage and aid musical ability in the attainment of high vocal or instrumental excellence, and of eminence in musical composition". "Scotland has no means of giving the highest musical education, and Scotland has no resident orchestra". On these two facts was based the necessity for an Association such as the Scottish Musical Society. The Society "will endeavour in every possible way to encourage the study of music and to render the profession of music dignified and honourable". A number of Scottish noblemen became Vice-Presidents of the Society and Professor Sir Herbert Stanley Oakeley, Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh was a Vice-President, ex-officio. The Council of the Society comprised Advocates, Lawyers and Sheriffs, University Professors, Merchants, Manufacturers, Writers and Stockbrokers from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Dundee. The objects of the Society were seen to be of "great national importance" and the Council were confident of "that support which is necessary to render its operations a complete success". The President of the Society, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry and the Chairman of the Council, The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Rosebery, each promised an initial donation of £500, however, this was just a promise and the money never actually changed hands. The ambitions of the Society were to raise £3000, to found an Academy of Music in Edinburgh, to offer a musical education for Scottish students. They were keen to establish an orchestra of local musicians and that pupils from the new Academy would be drafted into it to encourage and train native musicians in the great masterpieces of orchestral music. Sufficient funds were never achieved. In 1887 the suggestion was made that the Society should consider the "advisability of linking themselves and their academy … to the system of musical graduation … in the University of Edinburgh". The opportunity for this link came in 1890 with the proposed reforms in the administration of the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh being reviewed by the Scottish Universities Commission. At a meeting on 10 February 1890, it was resolved that the Society should formulate a scheme for musical education, to be submitted to the commissioners, which would more adequately reflect "the intentions of General Reid and the musical conditions of the time". The Academy of Music for Scotland as envisaged by the founders of the Society never opened and despite attracting interest from across Europe for a conductor for a resident orchestra in Scotland this ambition was overtaken by events and the establishment in 1891 of the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow. In 1900, "having accomplished all that is possible with the means at its disposal" the Society was would up by voluntary liquidation. The committee advised that, "the balance in the hands of the liquidator" be expended in the purchase of books for presentation to the University of Edinburgh for the purposes of the Music Class Room library in connection with the Reid Chair of Music. The three important legacies of the Society were the raising of awareness of the lack of facilities for music education in Scotland, their contributions to the reorganisation of the Reid Chair of Music and the establishment of the Faculty of Music in 1893-94 and the purchase of books and scores for the Reid Music Library, in the University of Edinburgh.

The collection is composed of three bound volumes being Sir John Fraser's journal of a tour made around the world in 1935. Each volume contains many pages of black and white photographs along with pages of typescript text describing the journey. The first entry in the journal is dated Tuesday 22 January 1935 and describes the Langholm Hotel and the start of the journey to Southampton to catch the ship (RMS 'Aquitania') bound for New York. A journey across the USA by train followed, via New Orleans, with San Francisco the final destination. From California Fraser would sail aboard the SS 'Mariposa' to Australia with stops in Los Angeles, Honolulu, Samoa (Pago Pago), Fiji, Auckland, and Sydney. The last entry is dated 19 February 1935 describing the Samoan islands and the crossing of the International Date Line. The second volume starts on 19 February 1935 just after the Date Line and almost on arrival in Fiji. The stops in Auckland and Sydney are also described. While in Sydney Fraser travelled to Brisbane and to Melbourne. He then resumed his sea voyage aboard the P&O vessel 'Narkunda' to Adelaide and onwards across the Great Australian Bight towards Fremantle and Perth. The final entry in the second volume is dated Thursday 21 March 1935 just past Western Australia into the Indian Ocean. The third volume starts with an entry dated Friday 22 March 1935 close to the midpoint of the Indian Ocean and near the Keeling Islands (or Cocos Islands). The ship sails on to Colombo (Sri Lanka) where Fraser takes a tour to Kandy, and then the voyage continues northwards up the Malabar Coast of India, past Goa, and towards Bombay (Mumbai). After Bombay the vessel sails towards the Arabian Sea heading for Aden, and then into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At Suez, Fraser left the vessel for a trip to Cairo and the National Museum and Pyramids, and then on to Port Said to pick up the ship again. His trip then took him to Malta. The last dated entry is Friday 12 April 1935 and describes Marseilles and the journey by train through France to the Channel and then to Dover and London and back to the Langholm. Within the fist volume there are some photographs of (possibly) the then 'new' Golden Gate Bridge in construction. At some stops on the voyage (e.g. Samoa, Fiji, and Auckland) and in Sydney and across Australia, Fraser had been in the company of doctors and other medical professionals with knowledge of the areas he visited. In Brisbane he gave a lecture. In Melbourne he visited hospitals and listened to talks, and in Adelaide he visited a nursing home, a children's hospital and had lunch with former Edinburgh graduates.

Contains three letters, largely unrelated. In the first letter, dated 15 Jan 1938 and numbered 8a (38), Thomson informs Ledermann that his [Thomson's] manuscript regarding univariate selection has been sent back to him by F C Bartlett, as the publisher requires it typed, and advises him that his own manuscript has likely been sent back for the same reason.  In the second letter, dated 17 Jan 1938 and numbered 8b (38), Thomson asks Ledermann to check the Psychometric offprints for any misprints. He refers to work by Dodd he had originally enclosed on loan from J Neyman. This has not survived in the collection. In the third letter, dated 12 Feb 1938 and numbered 8 (38), Thomson continues from 7 (38) (Coll-1064/40). He reproduces matrices of raw marks, and refers to partial correlations between the tests for constant average marks for each child. He provides several pages of examples and working.

The first Veterinary School in Edinburgh was founded by William Dick in 1823. Successful students at the School were presented with certificates from the Highland and Agricultural Society from 1828. In 1856, John Gamgee was appointed to the Veterinary School as an assistant to William Dick. Gamgee left the following year to open his own New Veterinary School in Edinburgh. The New Veterinary School moved to Bayswater, London, in 1865, where it became the Albert Veterinary College. It closed in 1868. A New Veterinary College was opened in Edinburgh by William Williams in 1873, but this too moved - to Liverpool in 1904 where it became the Veterinary School of the University of Liverpool.

John Archibald Watt Dollar, born in 1866, was a member of the equine veterinary practice T. A. Dollar and Sons, Veterinary Surgeons, New Bond Street, London. His father, the founder of the practice, was Thomas Aitken Dollar (1833-1909). The elder Dollar studied at the then Edinburgh Veterinary College and was awarded the Highland and Agricultural Society's certificate in 1851. In 1880, he was Vice-President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. By the time Dollar died on 26 September 1909, the veterinary practice was the largest in London with a presence (veterinary forges) in Baker Street, in Westminster, in Blackfriars, in Lambeth, in Belgrave Square, in Chelsea, and in Paddington. The practice also had paddocks at Wells House Farm, East Acton During the 1880s, John Archibald Watt Dollar and his older brother William Watt Dollar (1860-1938) joined their father's veterinary business, though the younger Dollar spent much of his time travelling abroad and visiting veterinary colleges. John was credited with introducing the first equine operating table to Britain - the table had been designed by himself. He published too and his works include: a translation ofMoeller's operative veterinary surgery(1894), then with Albert Wheatley and othersA handbook of horse-shoeing with introductory chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot(1898), then with Gustave Moussu,Diseases of cattle, sheep, goats and swine(1905), and with Heinrich Moeller, theRegional Veterinary Surgery and Operative Technique (incorporating Prof. Dr. H. Moeller's 'Veterinary Surgery'.)(1912), andDollar's Veterinary surgery : general, operative, and regionalwhich went to a 4th edition in 1950. John A. W. Dollar was Warden of the Worshipful Company of Farriers from 1900 to 1903, and was President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, circa 1904-1905. On the death of their father in 1909, the two brothers continued to work together at the practice which moved to Baker Street in 1919. They retired in 1926 however, and the practice was sold to a Mr. Tay. John Archibald Watt Dollar died in 1947.

William Carrick, son of a timber merchant, was born in Edinburgh on 31 December 1827. While still an infant, his family moved to the port of Kronstadt on the Gulf of Finland.In 1844 they moved to nearby St. Petersburg where William began studies in architecture at the Academy of Arts. In 1853 he continued his studies in Rome, but in 1856 he returned to St. Petersburg to become a photographer. He visited Edinburgh in order to gain more experience in the art and met photographic technician John MacGregor. Both men then went to St. Petersburg to establish a photographic studio. He soon made a name for himself capturing moments in Russian life, and became a pioneer of Russian photo-ethnography. Carrick and MacGregor made several rural expeditions, including in 1871 a month long trip to Simbirsk province. In 1876, he became the photographer of the Academy of Arts where he obtained a studio. An exhibition of his work had been put on in St. Petersburg in 1869 and this had been followed by one in London (1876), and in Paris (1878). William Carrick died of pneumonia in St. Petersburg in 1878.

Allan Maconochie, the Scottish judge, was born on 26 January 1748. He was the son of Alexander and Isabella Maconochie, Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton (now in West Lothian), to the west of Edinburgh. He was privately educated by Dr. Alexander Adam (1741-1809) who later on became Rector of the Royal High School in the city. Maconochie then studied at Edinburgh University taking the classes of Adam Fergusson, Professor of Moral Philosophy, and Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. He also studied Roman Law with the Professor of Civil Law, Robert Dick, from 1766 to 1769. He was then apprenticed to Thomas Tod, a well-known Writer to the Signet. During this period he co-founded the Speculative Society, an institution which 'trained' young men in 'public speaking, talent, and liberal thought'. On the conclusion of his studies in 1768, he went to Paris for a short time. In 1770 he became an Advocate and in Spring 1771 was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn, though he was never called to the English Bar. In 1773, he returned to France. On 11 November 1774, Maconochie married Elizabeth Welwood, a daughter of Robert Welwood of Garvock and Pitliver, Fife, and grand-daughter of Sir George Preston of Valleyfield. Also in 1774 he was elected to the General Assembly as a lay representative of the Burgh of Dunfermline. On 16 July 1779 Maconochie was appointed Professor of Public Law and Law of Nature at Edinburgh University, and also in 1779 he was elected Treasurer of the Faculty of Advocates. At the University, he advertised classes each year until he resigned the Chair in 1796. In 1788 he became Sheriff-Depute of Renfrewshire, and in 1796 he succeeded the judge and essayist Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby (1745–1795) as an ordinary Lord of Session taking his seat on the Bench on 11 March as Lord Meadowbank. Maconochie had also been a keen agriculturalist and he wrote anonymously theDirections for preparing manure from peat, and instructions for foresters(1802) which was reprinted in 1815 and 1842. Other publications includedConsiderations on the introduction of jury trial in civil cases into Scotland(1814) andEssay on the origin and structure of the European legislatures(1788). A portrait of Maconochie was said to have been painted by Sir Henry Raeburn in 1814. Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, died at Coates House, near Edinburgh, on 14 June 1816. He was buried in the private burial-ground on the Meadowbank Estate, Kirknewton. At his death he had been a Senator of the College of Justice, one of the Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, a Lord Commissioner of the Jury Court, and Vice-President of the Royal Society. Lord and Lady Meadowbank had four sons - the Scottish judge Alexander Maconochie-Welwood (1777-1861); Robert Maconochie (d. 1858) who became Mint Master in Madras, India; James Allan Maconochie (d. 1854), Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland; and, Thomas Tod Maconochie (d.1847). Alexander Maconochie-Welwood was also painted by Raeburn in 1816 and this portrait is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, USA.

      This is one of only two examples of Goethe's life-mask. It had been sent to Thomas Carlyle by J. P. Eckermann and hung in Carlyle's home for many years. On Carlyle's death it was presented to David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh, and on his death was given by the Masson family to Professor Hume Brown who in turn bequeathed it to Edinburgh University in 1918.
      Letter dated Weimar 17 June 1913 written by (possibly) Dr. W. Oettingen which indicates the origin of the mask, stating that it is a life-mask rather than a death-mask.
      Letter dated Edinburgh 25 April 1920 from A. Carlyle to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating that there is incertainty as to when 'my Uncle came into possession of the Goethe Mask'.
      Letter dated London 28 April 1920 from Rosaline Masson to the Librarian, F. C. Nicholson, Edinburgh University Library, indicating uncertainty as to how the mask came into Carlyle's possession.

Gaetano Donizetti was born in Bergamo on 29 November 1797. Donizetti was given some musical instruction from a priest who was also the musical director at the main church in Bergamo. As a choirboy though, Donizetti did not shine, but the priest recognised in him a nascent musical ability and managed to have him enrolled at the Liceo Filarmonico - the musical school - in Bergamo. He received training in fugue and counterpoint, and it was at the school that he launched his operatic career. After writing some minor work he went to Naples, then Rome and Milan, and wrote some 31 operas in only twelve years. He became internationally known in 1830 with his  Anna Bolena which was premiered in Milan. Donizetti's most famous work was Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). Gaetano Donizetti died insane on 8 April 1848.  Fausta is a two-act opera by Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian libretto was by Domenico Gilardoni, who died while writing it, and the remainder was written by Donizetti. The opera was given its debut on 12 January 1832 at the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, Italy.

Robert Laurie (1755-1836) and James Whittle (1757-1818) were London map, chart and printsellers active from 1794 to 1812 trading variously as Laurie and Whittle or Whittle and Laurie. Laurie began his career as a fine mezzotint engraver and exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1770-76. With Whittle, they took over Robert Sayer's business and Laurie stopped engraving. The firm published many atlases and maps and products used for jigsaws. Robert's son, Richard Holmes Laurie, succeeded him upon his retirement in 1812, and after Whittle's death in 1818 carried on the business alone until at least 1840. The firm still exists as Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd. and they have long specialized in marine charts. This map of Scotland was made by Laurie and Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, 1797.

At the time of his death in 2006, Professor William T. Baxter CA, was Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the London School of Economics (LSE). He had joined the LSE just after the end of the Second World War following periods spent as a student in the USA (at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard), as a part-time Lecturer at Edinburgh University, and as Professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. While in Edinburgh in the 1930s, Baxter met Kenneth E. Boulding (1910-1993), economist, philosopher, poet and Nobel-nominee. Born in Liverpool, England in 1910, and an Oxford garduate, Boulding had held fellowships at Harvard and Chicago, and after a short spell of teaching at Edinburgh University went to the USA for good and finally settled at the University of Colorado. Boulding's first bookEconomic analysiswas an introductory text book which 'blended Keynesian and neoclassical economic theory into a coherent synthesis'. He believed that 'depressions are due to too little private spending and that governments should run deficits to end them'. Baxter is lauded for his theory of deprival value and its use in nationalised and private utilities in the UK, and for his contribution to the accounting standards debate. Professor William T. Baxter died in 2006 at the age of 99-years, and just short of his 100th birthday. Professor Kenneth E. Boulding died in 1993.

The letter was written by Hugh MacDiarmid on 30 August 1958 from 'Brownsbank', Candymill, Biggar, Lanarkshire. It is addressed to Dr. Ringsleben - Mary Ringsleben having been awarded her Ph.D. two years earlier in 1956 (Aberdeen). MacDiarmid apologises for having 'retained your thesis so long'. He refers to having seen Dr. David Murison (deputy editor of the Scottish National Dictionary) in Edinburgh and that he had 'just missed you'. He describes the Ringsleben thesis as 'an excellent one and certainly the best thing written on Douglas by far'. He goes on to say that he is 'not going to make any little critical observations' apart from 'wishing to see it expanded and published'. Because it is 'on the short side for a book', he hopes she 'may decide to expand it'. MacDiarmid agrees 'in toto with all the main substance' of the study, and hopes that other subjects in Scots literature may attract her attention.

The Lords of the Congregation were a group of Protestant Scottish nobles who in the mid-16th century favoured reformation of the church along Protestant principles and a Scottish-English alliance. They had opposed the marriage of the young Queen Mary - daughter of James V and Mary of Guise - to the Dauphin of France (who became King Francis II of France from 1559 to 1560) and signed the 'First Band' or Covenant to work to make Scotland Protestant.  Following religious riots in Perth, the Lords gained support and provided military help to John Knox in opposing the troops of Mary of Guise. Near Cupar, in Fife, the Lords were strong enough to face-off a French and Scottish army jointly led by the Duke of Chatelherault, who as Regent had supported the French match, and D'Oysel the French king's lieutenant. By July 1559 the Lords of the Congregation had taken Edinburgh. As Edinburgh Castle was held against them, the Lords withdrew under the terms of the truce of the Articles of Leith.  In September, Chatelherault, now joined by his son the Earl of Arran, changed sides and became leader of the Congregation Lords. Mary of Guise, who had earlier offered a degree of religious tolerance, maintained that their motives were secular in part. Queen Mary and King Francis wrote to her in November 1559, declaring that the lords were acting maliciously under the name and cloak of religion. French re-inforcements pushed the Lords and their Protestant army back to Stirling and Fife. By the Treaty of Berwick in February 1560, the Lords brought in an English army to resist the French troops. The armed conflict now centered on the Siege of Leith. After the death of the Queen Regent in June and the conclusion of hosilities at Leith by the Treaty of Edinburgh in July, the Scottish Reformation was effected - through the Scots Confession of Faith - in the Parliament of Scotland in August 1560. After events reported in the document described here, the Congregation suffered a series of setbacks, with Mary of Guise retaking Edinburgh. However the arrival of English troops by sea in January 1560 sealed the course of reformation in Scotland. The Reformation Parliament which was convened in Edinburgh 10 July 1560 would appoint John Knox and others to draw up the Scots Confession of Faith. Thomas Henderson referred to in the document was a burgess of Jedburgh at this time, and Sir John Forster (c.1515-1602) was an English administrator in the Scottish borders, deputy warden of the English middle march.

This MS letter, addressed to 'Dear Sir', was written by Violet Jacob at Domaine de la Congue, Vence, in the Alpes Maritimes, France, on 6 April [no year] and presumably in 1936, given the reference in the letter to 'the honour done'. 1936 was the year in which she received the LL.D. from Edinburgh University. Domaine de la Congue is the location of a French 'Maison de retraite', a sanatorium for veterans today. The letter tells of how the letter reached her 'after various adventures' and that there has been a 'delay in answering it'. She continues: 'I cannot say how kind I think it of you to write. You tell me that there are countrymen of mine who will regard the honour done by Edinburgh University as a personal honour to themselves. All the degrees in Europe could not counterbalance that in my eyes'.

The project 'Platform technologies underpinning human embryonic stem cell derivation' operated from Roslin Institute's Division of Gene Expression and Development, of which Ian Wilmut was then Head. The project, led by Paul De Sousa, and which necessitated the use for research of oocytes and embryos, aimed to develop methods to derive human embryonic stem (hES) cells from fresh or frozen embryos which were surplus to IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis treatment, or parthenogenetic embryos originating from eggs matured in vitro; and to derive and maintain hES cells in a culture environment free of animal cell products. Roslin Institute first acquired a HFEA license for this project in July 2003. In February 2004, a variation to the license was granted to permit embryo donors to consent to the possible future therapeutic use of newly derived stem cells (R0136-1-b).
The project 'Derivation of research and therapeutic grade human embryonic stem cells', led by Paul De Sousa, began in July 2007 and aimed to derive and market research therapeutic-grade human embryonic stem cells under the not-for-profit company Roslin Cells Ltd.

Dr. Ian M. MacIntosh was a doctor for the whaling operation of Christian Salvesen Ltd. at Leith Harbour, South Georgia. He served as a 2nd Doctor between 1952 and 1953, and then 1960-1961, and then as sole doctor in 1961-1962 when the whaling station did not operate. His total whaling service was ten seasons. He normally looked after the health of the British whalers while the senior doctor cared for the Norwegians serving with the station. During 1956-1957 period, MacIntosh worked at the Grytviken station on South Georgia at the invitation of the then manager, Ken Pierce Butler who had previously been the Magistrate at King Edward Point, Grytviken. He had been requested to take over responsibility at Grytviken pending the arrival of a new doctor.

History of Art (formerly the Department of Fine Art) is a popular and long-established department of Edinburgh University. It has the oldest full-time Chair of Art History in Britain which was founded in 1880. History of Art is located at Minto House, 20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh, opposite the Royal Museum of Scotland, and within easy walking distance of most of the galleries and museums of central Edinburgh. History of Art has book, slide and photographic collections, as well as a photographic unit. There is also a laboratory for the demonstration of metalworking techniques and methods of conservation. A collection of postcards in photo albums and small file drawers was gathered together by members of Fine Art staff (in the Department's early years) for use as teaching aids before the advent of the popular colour slide format. The early postcard collection is important in that the cards are primarily of European buildings, many of which were lost or damaged during the revolutions and conflicts of the 20th century.

Geoffrey McKay Gibbon was born in Scarborough on 16 July 1896. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and obtained the degrees of M.B., Ch.B. in 1920. He was registered in Scotland on 8 July 1920. In the 1920s he was living in Elgin and Forres in Scotland, but in the early 1930s he was in Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire, England. It was at this point in his career that when requested by the Registrar of the General Medical Council (Scottish Branch) for notification of any changes to his qualifications, Gibbon's wife informed the Registrar that in September 1931 her husband 'was appointed Surgeon to the R.R.S. 'Discovery II' ' and that he would be absent from the UK for 2-years. The Royal Research Ship 'Discovery II', which had been built in 1929, had sailed from London with Gibbon on board on 3 October 1931 on its second Antarctic commission. The purpose of the expedition was research into the economic resources of the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies in the southern ocean, and more particularly into the most important of these resources at the time: the whale populations and the whaling industry of the waters of the latter, and beyond. The ship had been under the command of Lieut. A. L. Nelson R.N.R. and Comdr. W. M. Carey R.N. (retired), and surveyed from the Magellan Strait to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and then in the oceans around South Africa, South America, and New Zealand. By 1934 Gibbon was working for the Cyprus Medical Service, and in the 1940s he was with the Colonial Medical Service in Uganda. In 1954, the Medical register indicated that he was residing in the Port Elizabeth area of South Africa. Latterly, in the early-1960s (1962), Gibbon lived in Lympstone, Devon. His name ceased to appear in the Medical register after 1983.

The Scottish Widows Fund and Equitable Assurance Society, or Scottish Widows, was established in 1815 in Edinburgh. The idea for the setting up of a fund for the financial protection of the relatives of deceased clergyman and schoolmasters had been put forward by a group of prominent Scotsmen in March 1812. The fund would protect 'widows, sisters and other females' from poverty, and would be achieved by insuring capital sums on lives. The plan was extend the benefits of the fund to all parts of Britain. By September 1821, funds had reached £20,000, and in 1845 they stood at £1,700,000. In our own modern times Scottish Widows became part of Lloyds TSB Group.

In 1935 Leon Trotsky was invited by Edinburgh University students to become a candidate in the Rectorial election that year. Trotsky had been a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and was second only to Lenin in the early stage of Soviet communist rule. However, he lost out to Stalin in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death. It was Viscount Allenby of Megiddo who went on to become the Edinburgh University Rector in 1935, though he died very suddenly in London the following year from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm - on 14 May 1936. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson then stepped up us Rector. Just a year after the invitation from Edinburgh students, in 1936, Trotsky settled in Mexico. But, on 20 August 1940, acting on the orders of Stalin, Ramon Mercader attacked Trotsky with an ice pick and he died the next day.

Thomson offers to change the date of his previous dinner invitation, and states that he has enclosed the Doolittle calculation along with the letter and card from M S Bartlett referred to in his last letter. These items have not survived in the collection. Thomson suggests that while Bartlett's letter is interesting, he does not agree that his estimates are unbiased.  Thomson asks Ledermann to read through chapters three and four of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability.

Thomson outlines the problems and difficulties in Educational research, and how these can be resolved. These include the difficulty of selecting a representative group (the selection fallacy) and the importance of using suitable control groups in experimental work. Thomson also discusses the difficulty of co-operation with schools, particularly state or public schools, and the need for resources to be dedicated to research.  He expounds upon the usefulness of correlational studies and objective measures in educational research, illustrating his points with examples from studies conducted by international researchers, particularly within the USA.  He discusses how researchers should be trained, stressing the need for them to have a working creed or philosophy of education, and some training in statistical analysis. He also emphasises the need for careful planning and publication of results.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. As an invention which could separate male- and female- determining spermatozoa was potentially of wider commercial interest, a patent was applied for by Beatty to protect this work (known as 'Control of Sex Ratio in Mammalian Offspring') before Hancock submitted his results for publication. In 1976, funding was also received from the Scottish Milk Marketing Board to determine whether the sex-ratio control method could be applicable in cattle. A United States Patent Application was also put forward in 1977.

Thomson outlines some current problems in education, the most pressing of these arising from the raising of the school leaving age to 15. He briefly alludes to how the practical problems of the supply of specialist teachers and of buildings could meet the increased demand, before outlining his opinion on what secondary education should entail. He highlights the need for both vocational and cultural education in schools to ensure pupils of all abilities are prepared for the working world, whatever their profession or vocation. Thomson dispels the belief that cultural education is superior to that of vocational, and stresses that the two should not be in competition with one another, giving examples from the Youth Movement in Germany and successful trade schools in Germany and America, and strongly advocating the need for industry and education to be in closer contact. However, he also emphasises the importance of culture to an individual as part of their leisure time and the character-training role of education, enabling future employees to become balanced, satisfied individuals, and in turn better and more co-operative members of society. Equality is a pervading theme of the lecture, with Thomson stressing that exams, despite their pitfalls, eliminate nepotism. He discusses the positive implications of a common school for all which still makes provision for individual ability, giving examples from across continental Europe. He argues that society should continue to strive to ensure educational equality, even in the face of the differential birth rate.

Florence Bruce Dorward was born in Galashiels on 28 August 1912. She was the eldest child of Norman James Dorward and Elizabeth Haig Bruce. Her father, and his brother Adam, ran the family tweed clothing manufacturing firm J. & J. C. Dorward of Galashiels. In October 1925, following the death of her father, Florence was sent as a 'boarder' to St. Trinnean's School, Edinburgh. However, when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1928 she became a 'day-girl' at the school. St. Trinnean's School had been founded in Edinburgh by Miss Catherine Fraser Lee in 1922 and when it opened in October of that year it had just 60 girls as students. It was located in a building at 10 Palmerston Road, just off Grange Road in Edinburgh. Miss Lee practised the Dalton system of education with an emphasis on self-discipline. Later, in 1925, the school moved to St. Leonard's House, off Dalkeith Road in Edinburgh, but the outbreak of the Second World War then forced the girls and staff to be evacuated to Galashiels, to Gala House. In the 1950s, a series of St Trinian'scomedy films was made, starring Alastair Sim, George Cole, and Joyce Grenfell, and with the school depicted as a quite unorthodox one and where the girls wreaked havoc. Florence left the real St. Trinnean's in summer 1930 and then attended the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy which was located at Atholl Crescent, Edinburgh. In October 1931 she obtained a Housewife's Diploma First Class, and a Cook's Certificate From October 1931 to July 1932 Florence worked as a cook at Canaan Park School in South Oswald Road, Edinburgh, and between October 1933 and August 1935 she worked in Ettrick Road, Edinburgh - probably at a nursing home run by a Miss Eleanor Murdy - and then as a cookery demonstrator with the Southern Scottish Electric Supply Company Ltd., in Galashiels. Later in 1935, and until February 1936, she visited family in South Africa. Over 1938-1939 she was an Assistant Manageress at a Mackie's Buttery. During the war, on 29 June 1940, Florence Bruce Dorward married Thomas Cowan Steven who later became a Chartered Accountant and partner in the firm William Home Cook, Robertson Maxtone Graham, and Thomas McLintock. The couple had a son in 1942, and then a daughter in 1945. In May 1975, Florence gave her war-time wedding outfit, the receipts for it, and trousseau items, to the National Museum of Antiquities, Queen Street, Edinburgh, where it was displayed in the then 'Costume Gallery' a year later. She is also noted as having attended the St. Trinnean's School Reunion which was a 'sit down' buffet luncheon held on Thursday 22 October 1998 at the John McIntyre Centre, Pollock Halls, Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh. A look around the old school building had been planned too. A Reunion had also been held at the same place in 1985. Florence Bruce Steven died on 25 November 2008. She had been pre-deceased by her husband, 10 May 1988. Her old school, St. Trinnean's, had closed its doors in 1946 on the retiral of Miss Lee. St. Leonard's Hall which housed St. Trinnean's between 1925 and the outbreak of war is now within Pollock Halls of Residence, Edinburgh University, and has an administrative, hospitality and conference function. It was built in 1869 by John Lessels (1809-1883) in Baronial style. During the First World War the building was used as a Red Cross Hospital, and during the Second World War it became an Air Raid Precautions and Home Guard Headquarters. St Leonard's became a hall of residence for female students until the completion of the more modern buildings on the Pollock site from the 1960s onwards.

Sarah Boreland of Dumfries had been instructed 'in the knowledge of the Practice of Midwifery' by Professor James Hamilton and had attended the Edinburgh General Lying-in Hospital. Hamilton considered 'her to be properly qualified for the important duty of midwife'. Boreland may have continued her career later on in Australia. The qualifying certificate issued to Boreland by Professor Hamilton had been discovered in New South Wales. James Hamilton was born in Edinburgh in 1767. He was one of two sons of Alexander Hamilton (1739-1802), Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh University. James Hamilton was given medical training by his father and became his assistant at the age of twenty-one. He and his father founded Edinburgh's Lying-in Hospital in Park Place in 1793, and later on this enterprise would become supported partly from his own funds. In 1800, Hamilton succeeded his father as Professor of Midwifery at the University. Their subject however had been slow to be accepted by the Senate as part of the medical curriculum and in 1815 Hamilton raised the matter of recognition for midwifery. He faced hostility however, particularly from Dr. James Gregory (1753-1821), and recognition would not be achieved until 1830.  Although his classes were, for a long time, non-essential for graduation, they were well attended, and Hamilton's contribution to midwifery included advocacy of uterine suture after Caesarian operations and the introduction of the term 'eclampsia' for convulsions in labour or peurperium. Hamilton's publications included A collection of engravings designed to facilitate the study of midwifery (1796), Hints for the treatment of the principal diseases of infancy and childhood (1809), and Practical observations on various subjects relating to midwifery (1836-1837). Professor James Hamilton died in November 1839.

Phrenology was the study of the skull as a guide to individual human nature and tendencies - looking at the skull for indications of mental faculties and traits of character. Although it was a popular field of study well into the 20th century it is today thoroughly discredited as a scientific system, though it is still of historical and social interest. George Combe of Edinburgh was a leading exponent of phrenology during the mid-19th century and wrote a number of popular books on the system. The son of a brewer, George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in theEdinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started thePhrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included:Elements of phrenology(1824);System of phrenology(1825-1853); and,The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects(1828) George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

William Muir was born in Glasgow in 1819. He was educated at Kilmarnock Academy and then at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities. After his university education he gained a post with the East India Company in the North-West Provinces of India. He entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1837 and became Secretary to the Governor of the North-West Provinces at Agra. His work, particularly during the Sepoy Mutiny (when he was in charge of the Intelligence Department) and his experience, influence, and writing on the history of Islam, led to his appointment in 1868 as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces. He had been created Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1867. Between 1874 and 1876 Muir was Financial Minister to the Government of India, and from 1876 to 1885 he was a Member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. On leaving India he joined the Council of India in London but resigned on his appointment as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh University in 1885. During his term of office, the University underwent many changes as a result of the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. Muir resigned in 1903 because of ill health and died at Dean Park House in Edinburgh on 11 July 1905.

In May 1960, Solly Zuckerman approached Waddington on behalf of the Ford Foundation, who wished to stimulate research into the physiology of reproduction. Waddington replied putting forward the names of Beatty and Anne McLaren as best placed for taking this research opportunity further. An application was submitted to the Ford Foundation in August 1960, but it appears that nothing further occurred until February 1963, when Professor Emil Witschi (consultant to the Ford) approached Waddington about potential Ford Foundation support for work in population control. An application was submitted and proved successful: in July 1963, the Ford Foundation awarded the University of Edinburgh a grant of $40,000 over a four-year period for research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction by R.A Beatty and Anne McLaren within the ARC Unit of Animal Genetics at the Institute of Animal Genetics. The grant partly funded four new laboratory rooms and a building known as 'the Ford Hut' at the Institute.

Albert E. G. Pilliner was born in Glasgow in 1909 but spent much of his childhood in Shrewsbury, where his father worked as an engineer. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury. Although he was accepted by Cambridge University, he was unsuccessful in receiving a scholarship and so went to Birmingham University where he studied Chemistry. On graduating, Pilliner went into teaching. During the Second World War, he was selected for work in a government research facility near Wrexham and there he used his statistical knowledge and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of explosives. It was at this period in his life that Pilliner met William Emmett, another statistician. After the war, he took up teaching again, teaching Chemistry and Physics, and continued to keep in touch with Emmett. It was possibly through this communication that Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson came to hear of Pilliner, because in 1949 he took up a post as lecturer at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). On Thomson's retiral in 1951 and subsequent death in 1955, Pilliner and his colleagues continued Thomson's work within what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment, University of Edinburgh - dubbed Room 70 during Thomson's time. Pilliner took over the running of Room 70 as well as lecturing to the Dip.Ed. and B.Ed. courses for a number of years. In 1961, after a successful research trip to Israel on behalf of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Pilliner was invited to work for the NFER (National Foundation of Educational Research) which he turned down. By the 1970s however, most of his time was spent working as a consultant to the British Council, UNESCO, and other bodies, and he conducted research into the examination systems of many countries including Mauritius, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Albert E. G. Pilliner died in 2003.

George McDonald Sutherland was born in 1886, the son of a master-mason George P. Sutherland. This elder Sutherland, educated at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, had served as an apprentice sculptor in Edinburgh, London and New York, and in 1881 had founded the firm of George Sutherland and Sons (Galashiels), Sculptors and Monumental Masons. The firm operated throughout the Borders over the next 100 years, with war memorials and grave stones comprising a large part of the business, and ran additional businesses in Hawick and in Tweedmouth. The carvings on the local Galashiels Post Office building were created by Sutherland in 1886. The younger George McDonald Sutherland had been apprenticed as a young architect to the firm of Sir Robert Lorimer in 1903, at the age of 17. He subsequently went to Toronto, Canada, to start an architectural business and bought land there too. On the outbreak of the Great War however, he came back to Scotland to enlist and joined the 4th King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB). Sadly he was killed at Arras on 9 April 1917 and was buried there.

The English poet and radio producer Terence Rogers Tiller was born in Truro, Cornwall, on 9 September 1916. His early career was in medieval history at the University of Cambridge. During the World War II he taught in Cairo, and then in 1946 he joined the BBC. In 1955 he was producer of the first BBC radio adaptation of The lord of the rings. He later brought work by Mervyn Peake to the airwaves. Other BBC projects led to his translations of Piers Plowman and Dante, and the Chess Treasury of the Air (1966) for Penguin, which he edited. As a poet, he was published by Hogarth Press: Poems (1941) and The inward animal (1943). Notes for a myth (1968) and That singing mesh, and other poems (1979) were published by Chatto and Windus in the Phoenix Living Poets series. He also edited New Poems (1960) with Anthony Cronin and Jon Silkin.  Terence Rogers Tiller died on 24 December 1987.  Tiller had also translated A season in hell by Arthur Rimbaud, and Four of a kind by Paul Verlaine.  The French poet Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud was born in Charleville, Ardennes, on 20 October 1854. He produced his works while still in his late teens, Victor Hugo describing him at the time as 'an infant Shakespeare', and he had given up creative writing altogether before the age of 20. As part of the decadent movement, Rimbaud influenced modern literature, music, and arts, and prefigured surrealism. He was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul, traveling extensively on three continents before his death. Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud died from cancer just a few days after his 37th birthday on 10 November 1891. Paul-Marie Verlaine, born in Metz on 30 March 1844, was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the fin de siecle in international and French poetry. He died in Paris on 8 January 1896.

Thomson begins by introducing the concept of individual differences in general terms, before moving on to his own topic of intelligence, and discussing the extent of individual intelligence differences. He illustrates the wideness of the intellectual range within the population by reproducing Cyril Burt's table, Distribution of Intelligence among Children and Adults, which contains suggested IQ scores for different levels of schooling and occupational complexity in England. Thomson gives examples of individuals at the extreme ends of intelligence, referring to precocious children, and to a report by the Mental Deficiency Committee on the prevalence of feeble-mindedness in the general population. He argues that this range is both inevitable and vital for society's progress.  Thomson then talks about the measurement of intelligence and stresses that we cannot fully differentiate human intelligence differences into classes, because in reality no such distinctions exist. Instead, intelligence tests identify an individual's position on a continuum.  Thomson ends with a discussion of the idea of selection, emphasising that it is often wrongly thought of as a process of exclusion, when in fact it should regarded and used as part of the process in establishing the correct path for the student, taking into account both their abilities and their interests. In this process, the educators have a social and professional responsibility to guide them in establishing the correct path for them as individuals. He argues that selection should be based not on a single test but following consideration of the pupils' performance throughout their primary school career.

John Fraser was born in Tain in 1885. Following his education in Tain he studied at Edinburgh University where he undertook medical graduating with honours in 1907 and gaining the Class Medal in Clinical Surgery.  He served as House Surgeon and Assistant Surgeon to Sir Harold Stiles, both in private practice and at Chalmers Hospital. It was his research with his mentor on bone and joint tuberculosis in children which established his surgical reputation. he succeeded Stiles as the regius Professor of Clinical Surgery in 1927. During the First World War, Fraser served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in France, and was awarded the Military Cross after being wounded in 1916. During his subsequent career, he developed a great interest in cardiac surgery and was the first surgeon in Scotland and only the second in the British Isles to undertake ligation of a patent ductis arteriosis. He received international recognition through the fellowship of various surgical associations and was made honorary fellow of the Royal Australasian and American Colleges of Surgeons. In 1935, he left London for Southampton and on to New York on board the RMS 'Aquitania' setting out on a world tour. He travelled overland to Los Angeles and crossed the Pacific to Honolulu, to Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. During the journey he visited hospitals and delivered lectures. Also in 1935, Fraser was appointed surgeon to His Majesty the King in Scotland. He was made Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1937 and was created a Baronet in 1942. He succeeded Sir Thomas Henry Holland as Principal of Edinburgh University in 1944, and on his untimely death he was succeeded in turn by Sir Edward Victor Appleton in 1948.  Sir John Fraser, Bt. KCVO., MC., MD., Ch.M., LL.D., FRCSE., FACS., and Honorary Surgeon in Scotland to HM the King, had died in 1947.

Probably the earliest documented use of an instrument which we today might regard as a passport is an item mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah. During the reign of the ancient Persian ruler Artaxerxes (around 450 BC), the prophet Nehemiah, who was working as a royal cup-bearer but who wished to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, was granted letters from the king requesting the governors of the lands beyond the Euphrates to grant him safe passage to Judah. Closer to our own time and place, in Britain one of the earliest documents to which we can refer as a 'safe conduct' document appeared during the reign of King Henry V of England in an Act of the English Parliament dated 1414. In those days, such a document could be issued by the king to anyone, whether English or not. Later on, from 1540, it became the job of the Privy Council to grant travelling papers and from this point onwards the expression 'passport' began to be used though whether or not it was derived from the notion of travellers passing through seaports ('passer', to pass, and 'port', meaning port or harbour) or through gates in city walls is open to debate. One document issued in June 1641 and signed by King Charles I still exists. Late in the 18th century, the office of the Secretary of State took charge of issuing passports, and it is the Home Office that retains it today. From this time on - from around 1794 - records remain of every British passport which had been granted. They continued to be available to foreign nationals too, and until 1858 they were written in French. After that date, the passport acquired its role as a British identity document. Even so, passports were not generally required for international travel until the First World War. In 1914, and as a result of the British Nationality and Status Aliens Act, the first modern British passport was used. As a result of agreement on the standardisation of passports reached between the member states of the League of Nations, a 'blue' coloured passport still recognised by many today was issued in 1920 and that format served until 1988 and gradual replacement by the 'burgundy' coloured European version in 1988. The letters of safe conduct in this small collection are believed to have been intended for use in the Caucasus, perhaps in Daghestan where the only written language in the nineteenth century was Arabic.

The lecture largely concerns how selection for university entrance can be made more fair and equal, beginning at the age of eleven with the eleven-plus examination which determines a child's entry into a grammar or a modern school, the latter of which removes the possibility of attending university.  Thomson argues for a mechanism by which pupils wrongly rejected by grammar schools may still enter university. He discusses the influence of industry and character on examination and future success, and the merits of examinations versus teachers' opinions as predictors of future success.  Thomson defends and praises the use of examinations as favourable to nepotism, but discusses how the examination process could be improved upon. He describes a system of school selection used in Saxony, Germany, in 1933, which combined an examination similar in structure and content to an intelligence test, with the schools' opinion of its candidates. He contrasts this to the American state universities, which have a list of affiliated schools which can recommend students to pass into the Freshman year with no examination. Thomson also discusses the use of intelligence tests in selecting candidates for university entrance in order to make a first reduction of the suitable candidates, but stresses this method could not be used on its own for selection. In relation to this, he discusses his specific experiences at Edinburgh University of testing almost the complete entry in 1950 to the faculties of Arts, Science, and Medicine with an Adult Intelligence Test. Also includes a printed flyer for the lecture series.

The son of a veterinary surgeon, James Roland Rider was born in Beamish, Durham, in N.E.England, on 13 November 1894. He was educated at St. Bees, Cumbria, and at Newcastle Royal Grammar School. In 1912 he went to Edinburgh to study at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College but in 1914 the outbreak of war interrupted his studies. Rider enlisted in the Scots Greys and he served at Gallipoli. In 1916 he returned to the Dick Vet', and graduated in 1917, becoming a Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. He then re-enlisted, serving as a Captain in the Army Veterinary Corps (AVC) until the end of the Great War. He was awarded the British War and Victory medals.From 1919 he was employed as a vet by Pease and Partners Ltd. owners of several mines in the coalfields of Durham and Teeside. In 1928 he declined the offer of a Lectureship at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, only to suffer a cut in working hours the following year due to the Depression which began in 1929. In 1930 however, Rider began his own private practice in Darlington.In 1932 he published a paper on 'Hypertrophy and diverticulae in the ileum in pit ponies' for the Veterinary Record, British Veterinary Association.James Roland Rider died of pulmonary tuberculosis in Urpeth, Durham, on 19 November 1942.

In the first letter, dated 6 Sept 1938 and numbered 37 (38), Thomson informs Ledermann of his plans for the next few weeks, which include going to London and to a Carnegie conference in Dinard. He reassures him that he will have an advocate in the Faculty of Science in Edmund Whittaker, and tells him he hopes the decision of the Senate with regards to his DSc will be a positive one. Thomson also asks Ledermann to send his Note on Sampling Distribution to him so he can read it, and remarks that Aitken found it interesting.  In the second letter, dated 11 Sept and numbered 37a (38), Thomson comments on Ledermann's manuscript, telling him he found it interesting, and refers to his use of the term correlational matrices. Thomson advises Ledermann that Biometrika would be a good place to publish, suggesting that Aitken might commend it to Egon Pearson. He informs Ledermann that any offprints can be paid for through the fund.

North Bridge with a tram car, and Waverley Station in the foreground. The Waverley Market Hall, the low building rising above the glass roof of the station, was fundamentally an empty hall, but used for shows of all kinds, circuses and sometimes dramatic entertainments. Sometimes there were flower beds on the flat roof. Its interior was quite unlike its successor, the Waverley Market, which dates from 1984/85 and consists of shopping mall at different levels ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam and Walker).

This autograph letter signed is dated 10 February 1933, and was written from The Old Rectory, Larling, nr. Norwich. The letter is not addressed to anyone by name and Murry begins by stating that he is 'not perfectly certain of your name even'. It continues by referring to an 'issue between Mrs Carswell and me' which 'is at once simple, and not simple'. Murry states that he does 'not doubt, for one moment, that her original impulse was one of good faith'. He writes, 'She felt it her duty to defend Lawrence against me'. That had been 'her first mistake' one 'made in absolutely good faith, but a mistake of the most serious kind'. Mrs. Carswell 'did not, and does not, understand' his work Son of Woman. He continues by saying that having 'misunderstood' and 'misinterpreted' his work as an attack on Lawrence 'she concluded' that he 'was a sort of devil incarnate'. The letter continues in that vein as he defends his postion to the unnamed correspondent.

This unpublished report by Professor Emmett L. Bennett Jr. is of the proceedings of a conference held in Wisconsin in 1961, called the Mycenaean Colloquium. The distinguished Classics scholar, Emmett L. Bennett, born in Minnesota in 1918. Bennett is the founding father of the study of Mycenaean scripts. The focus of his life work was the discovery in 1939 of hundreds of Linear B tablets in Pylos, Greece, by the American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887-1971) with whom he had worked while earning his Ph.D. at McMicken College of Arts and Sciences, University of Cincinnati. Bennett edited and analysed the primary inscriptions of the pre-alphabetic syllabic script, Linear B, and to do this he used the same skills he had employed as a cryptographer during World War II.

These files seem to relate to research which Beale was conducting with Piero Luporini relating to the unusual properties of inducing mating of Euplotes minuta strain '1A' in other species of Euplotes. The study was attempting to 'further characterise the purified E. minuta pheromone and study its binding to the different cell types, in order to understand the basis of this unusual case of interspecific cell recognition and mating induction.'

Contains a letter from Thomson, dated 8 Nov 1937 and numbered 30 (37) in which he asks Ledermann to post an enclosed letter to Dr Horst if he thinks it correct; the enclosed letter to Dr Horst, dated 8 Nov 1937 and numbered 30a (37); and a further letter from Thomson to Ledermann, dated 12 Nov 1937 and numbered 30b (37) which asks him to obtain details of translations of Pliny's letters held at Edinburgh University Library for the use of Thomson's son, Hector. The letter to Dr Horst regards Horst's manuscript, which he sent to Thomson for his comments. Thomson finds many aspects of the paper problematic. He outlines these, explaining why, and encourages Horst to have the paper read by others too.

The Dutch marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger was born in 1633 and baptised in Leiden, Holland, in the Dutch Republic. He was a son of Willem van de Velde the Elder, also a marine painter. The younger van de Velde, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute, and had achieved great celebrity in his art before he came to London. In 1673 he moved to England, where he was engaged by Charles II, at a salary of £100, to aid his father in 'taking and making draughts of sea-fights'. His part of the work was to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder van de Velde. He was also patronised by the Duke of York and by various members of the nobility. Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. Willem van de Velde the Younger died on 6 April 1707 in London, England and was buried at St. James's Church. The MP John Frederick Campbell, 1st Earl Cawdor, was born on 8 November 1790. He was born the son of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor and Lady Caroline Howard and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1912. In 1827 he became Viscount Emlyn of Emlyn and Earl Cawdor of Castlemartin in the county of Pembroke. In June 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was MP for Carmarthen from 1813 to 1821 and Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire from 1817 to 1860. He died on 7 November 1860 on his family estate at Stackpole, Pembrokeshire. In 1859, prior to his death, the Earl had acquired photographs of van de Velde drawings which were placed into an album. The photographer of the van de Velde drawings is unknown.

He informs Ledermann that the calculations are two Thurstone centroid analyses, one on 441 boys, the other on 430 girls, all Scottish children born on the 1st of Feb, May, Aug, and Nov of 1926.

The Scottish writer and poet Violet Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine on 1 September 1863 in Angus. The Kennedy-Erskine family owned the Dun estate near Montrose. She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944).  On 3 July 1936, Violet Jacob, authoress, was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Edinburgh. She was noted as a 'writer and poet' in the University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 8. 1936-1937., p34. Latterly Violet Jacob had lived in Kirriemuir, Angus, and she died on 9 September 1946.

Thorndike praises Thomson's work, claiming it refutes Spearman's Two factor Theory. He refers to work with Spearman, Helzinger, Kelley, and others on unitary traits, and raises the possibility of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to allow Thomson to continue with his research.

Thomson has annotated the paper throughout with calculations, formulae, and marginal notes.

The notes taken down into this small bound pocket note-book of 131 handwritten pages are believed to have formed part of the Guy's lecture series - 'Elements in the Practice of Physic'. One of the early pages bears the inscription 'John Bethell, Lincoln's Inn Field' but it isn't clear if this was the same individual who took the notes or someone who subsequently owned them. The volume may be particularly important in that the contents significantly pre-date - when compared - the first edition of the published version of Saunders' lectures in 1780. Based upon differing formulations for remedies included in the notes and changes in topics covered, it is believed that the notes may have been taken down circa 1775 or possibly earlier. They are believed to pre-date the manuscript lecture notes held at the Wellcome Library (1780-1782) and the Heritage Library of the Royal College of Physicians (1782). Other Saunders' lecture notes at the Royal College of Surgeons were taken down in 1784, and those at the Royal Society of Medicine dating from 1795. Section headings and formulations for remedies contained in 'Elements in the Practice of Physic' include: Of the Inflammatory Fever; Of the Nervous Fever; Of Intermittent Fevers; Of the Malignant Angina; Of the Inflammation of the Intestines; Of the Rheumatism; Of the Measles; Of the Dropsy; Of Indigestion; Of the Epilepsy; Of the Tetanus; Of Insanity; Of Women During the Time They Are With Child and After Delivery; and, Diseases of Young Children.

Carl O G Andriessen was Thomson's friend at Strasbourg, and a fellow ordinary member of the students' natural science and mathematics club. Ordinary members wore no uniform, but a watch fob bearing the club's coat of arms, which Andriessen gave Thomson. Thomson discusses their friendship in chapter 6 of The Education of an Englishman, pp. 51-70.

While it is not clear who wrote these notes of lectures given by Professor David Hume (1757-1838), it is believed that they are either a fair copy made by a student, or copied for sale from the notes of another student. The volume comprises the first twenty-six lectures of Professor Hume given from 12 November 1805 to 27 December 1805. Hume was Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, 1786-1822.

Thomson thanks Ledermann for the sheets, though concludes they were not of great value. He refers to trying times, sending Ledermann good wishes and stating that they will pass. He informs Ledermann that he almost has the calculations accurate, which will allow for the further analysis discussed in previous letters. He tells Ledermann about Hector's travels in Cyprus studying Byzantine buildings, confiding that he isn't sure where he is now, but thinks he is possibly in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter

Some of the anonymous pieces are mentioned in Thomson's handwritten bibliographies, but have been omitted from the typed versions. It has been assumed, therefore, that their inclusion has been due to the fact that they refer to or summarize Thomson's work, rather than his having produced them, particularly since Thomson often includes the work of others in his handwritten bibliographies.

The lecture regards the problems of examinations at university level, particularly with regards to external and internal examiners, and how these can be resolved. Thomson compares the Scottish system to that of the English, paying particular attention to the examination processes for ordinary degrees in which the Scottish student participates in both the Class Certificate system and the wider examination system of the university; and the English system in which there is a meeting of examiners to decide borderline cases. The notes are incomplete, and largely in draft form.

The collection is composed of 5 menu cards from the Annual Dinners of the Edinburgh University Forestry Society for the years 1929-1932 - the years covering the course followed by James Robert Thom - and for 1954. The latter was 25 years after Thom's first year at University. The cards for 1929 and 1932 are heavily autographed, and the card for 1931 notes that J. R. Thom was the Chairman which meant that he was required to propose a toast to 'the guests' during the 1931 Annual Dinner. Between 1929 and 1932 the dinners were held at the Royal Hotel, Princes Street, Edinburgh, and in 1954 at the George Hotel, George Street, Edinburgh.

The Scottish poet, author and dramatist, George Mackay Brown, was born on 17 October 1921. His work has a distinctly Orcadian character and he is considered one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century. Brown had a long association with publishers Chatto and Windus. This had begun in 1959 when they published, under its Hogarth Press imprint, his second volume of poetry Loaves and Fishes. He remained with Chatto and Windus until 1984. It had been Hugo Brunner (Chatto and Windus) who first suggested that someone should write the story of his life, and the writer proposed was Maggie Fergusson. The job was done with Fergusson's The Life of George Mackay Brown published in 2006 by John Murray. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996. Hugo Brunner (Sir Hugo Lawrence Joseph Brunner) was born on 17 August 1935. His parents were Sir Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897-1982) and Dorothea Elizabeth, daughter of the Victorian era actor manager Henry Irving (1838-1905). Hugo Brunner was educated at Eton and he studied at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated with the degree of MA (Hons). Between 1958 and 1965, Brunner was with Oxford University Press and was OUP representative in Hong Kong, 1960-1962. From 1966 until 1976 he was Sales Director with Chatto and Windus, publishers. He returned to OUP in 1977 and was then back again at Chatto and Windus in 1979 as Managing Director, then Chairman, until 1985. Brunner has also been Director of Caithness Glass Ltd., 1966-1996, and Chairman 1984-1991. He has seen involvement with Brunner Investment Trust Plc., 1987-1999, and with SCM Press Ltd., 1991-1997.  On 7 January 1967, Brunner married Mary Rose Catherine Pollen, daughter of Arthur Joseph Lawrence Pollen and Hon. Daphne Baring, and grand-daughter of Cecil Baring, 3rd Baron Revelstoke of Membland. Hugo Brunner contested the constituency of Torquay for the Liberals in 1964 and 1966. He was Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, England, between 1996 and 2008, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

John Pitcairn Mackintosh was born on 24 August 1929, in Simla, India. He was educated at Melville College in Edinburgh and the studied at Edinburgh University where he attended the lectures of, among others, Dr. Balfour-Melville. He also studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and at Princeton. Mackintosh went on to become an Assistant Lecturer at Glasgow University, 1953-54, Lecturer in History, Edinburgh University, 1954-61, Senior Lecturer in Government at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, 1961-63, and he was Senior Lecturer in Politics at Glasgow University, 1963-65, and Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde, 1965-66. Later in his life, 1977, he became part-time Professor and Head of the Department of Politics at the University of Edinburgh. He had a political career too, contesting Edinburgh Pentlands for the Labour Party in 1959, and Berwick and East Lothian in 1964. He became MP for Berwick and East Lothian in 1966 succeeding William Anstruther-Gray, but in the February 1974 election he was defeated by the Conservative Michael Ancram. He regained it again in the second 1974 election, in October. Mackintosh was fierce proponent of devolution in Scotland. His publications include The British cabinet (1962), Nigerian goverment and politics (1966), The devolution of power (1968), and The government and politics of Britain (1970). In addition he edited British prime-ministers in the twentieth century, Vol.1: Balfour to Chamberlain  (1970) and British prime-ministers in the twentieth century, Vol.2: Churchill to Callaghan (1978). Mackintosh was also a freelance writer and television commentator. John Pitcairn Mackintosh MP (Labour) died in office on 30 July 1978. He was succeeded in his constituency by John Home Robertson.

At E2010.16 there is an 'autograph letter signed' from Thomas Lyle to John Aitken at Gayfield Square, Edinburgh, dated 28 May 1827. The letter is concerned with Lyle's compilation Ancient ballads and songs and how, having received 'notice from Mr. Lumisden', he is aware of Aitken's 'willingness to suggest a few amendments and additions to the Lyrical MS'. Lyle has heard much about 'Mr Aitken's abilities, from Glasgow friends', and would regard 'any little assistance' while the 'work is going through the press' to be 'a particular favour'.

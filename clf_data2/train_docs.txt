Thomas Campbell was born on 27 July 1777 in Glasgow where he went to school showing promise as a poet and an interest in Classics. He studied at Glasgow University from 1791 excelling in the Classics and as a translator of Greek poetry, and then went on to study Hebrew and theological subjects with the intention of going into the Church. By the end of his studies in 1796 (and with some earlier interruption), he had attended classes in Roman law and decided to go into the legal profession. This new direction took him to Edinburgh where he first became a copying clerk then became involved in literary work and private teaching, and writing poems. Campbell's work from this period included the Wounded Hussar and the minor poems: the Dirge of Wallace, Epistle to three ladies, and Lines on revisiting the River Cart. In 1799 however, his Pleasure of hope became instantly popular, with a passage on Poland having particular resonance among Scottish patriots after the dismemberment of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In June 1800, he went across to the European mainland, settling first in Hamburg but also visiting Regensburg (Ratisbon), Munich, and Leipzig. While abroad he wrote The exile of Erin, Ye mariners of England, and The soldier's dream. When the British fleet bore down on Copenhagen in 1801, Campbell wrote The Battle of the Baltic, a strenuous war song. His return to Britain in 1801 found him alternating between England and Scotland and among his social circle were Dugald Stewart and Lord Minto. Then, in 1803, he married Matilda Sinclair (died 1828) and the Campbells settled in London, at Sydenham. By 1834, Campbell had achieved much social and academic recognition, and had been Rector of Glasgow University three times in succession beating off Sir Walter Scott as a rival the third time. However, it had not been known that he sought the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, which ambition is revealed in a letter to Francis Jeffrey, the Lord Advocate. In it, he writes that he is thinking about competing for this position, and asks for Jeffrey's support. The establishment of the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh University, created for Hugh Blair in 1762, is often seen as marking the start of the formal teaching of English Literature as an academic discipline at university level. Other works by Campbell include Gertrude of Wyoming, Locheil, Hohenlinden, Navarino, Heligoland death-boat, Pilgrim of Glencoe, Song of the colonists, and Pilgrim. Thomas Campbell died in Boulogne on 15 June 1844. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Please note that the 2275 items recorded within this catalogue are a combination of those items identified and catalogued between 1985 and 1998 by staff and volunteers at the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower, along with previously uncatalogued material that was also transferred to the University of Edinburgh Special Collections from the former Patrick Geddes Centre for Planning Studies at the Outlook Tower. The new material was uncovered during the 2016-2020 stock-check undertaken as part of the Wellcome Research Resource-funded archive cataloguing project "Evergreen: Patrick Geddes and the Environment in Equilibrium." All of the items recorded within the printed legacy catlaogue (1998) are listed in the new online catalogue (2020) but there are a significant number of individual items or entire series from the legacy catalogue which were not located during the 2016-2020 stock-check.  The catalogue descriptions for missing items are included in the new online catalogue for the purposes of audit trail and to allow for items to be easily integrated into the collections catalogue should they be rediscovered at a later date.

The doctor and anaesthetist writer Samuel William Carruthers was born on 7 February 1866 in Islington, London. In 1883, while in his 6th Form at Dulwich College, he was awarded a Royal Geographical Society Prize Medal. He studied at Edinburgh University obtaining the degrees of M.B., C.M. on 1 August 1889, and then the M.D. on 29 July 1899 having written 'A contribution to the mechanism of articulate speech'. His doctoral piece was 'deemed worthy of competing for Gold Medals'. In 1888 he had read a dissertation on aphasia before the Royal Medical Society in Edinburgh. While at University too he was Secretary of the Rectorial Association and in 1887 he seconded the nomination of the Marquis of Lothian for the Lord Rectorship in succession to Lord Iddesleigh. Carruthers was registered as a doctor on 17 October 1889, in Scotland. Prior to the award of his M.D., in 1896 he had married Emily Hopkins Haldeman (1864-1932). During the First World War he treated many of the refugees from Belgium without charge. He had practiced medicine in Norwood and retired at the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout that war however, he served as an anaesthetist at Norwood Cottage Hospital Carruthers had also been a writer and historian, and Latin and Greek scholar, and had been Elder of the Presbyterian Church. Towards the end of his life he learned Danish in order to translate the British Medical Journal for Denmark. Dr. Samuel William Carruthers died on 6 April 1962 at Norwood Cottage Hospital, Norwood, London.

Thomson discusses how qualities and skills gained at university can be transferred to students' working lives as well as their roles as good citizens. He discusses the extent to which such transfer is possible, citing the results of psychological experiments of learning.  Thomson discusses the importance of understanding, not only between students of various disciplines, but also between the student and those from other walks of life. He stresses the importance that the specialist be a scholar, rather than merely a repetitive worker, and discusses the conflicting needs of specialism and wider study. The lecture is incomplete.

John Brown (fl. 1824-1834) and Thomas S. Brown (fl. 1828-1835) came from Lanarkshire and may have been brothers, possibly from Edmonston. They both studied medical subjects from the mid-1820s to the early-1830s at Edinburgh University and at the Royal Infirmary and other institutions in the city. William B. Clark, also a student in Edinburgh in the 1820s, went on to become a Minister in Canada preaching at Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Quebec City. From the class cards and tickets, library tickets and letters of certification it is possible to trace the study pattern of the men - studies under the great professors of nineteenth century Edinburgh - at the University, the Royal Infirmary, the Edinburgh New Town Dispensary, and at the Royal College of Surgeons. John Brown appeared to have been studying from at least November 1824 when the class cards show that he attended classes in Greek given by Professor George Dunbar. In 1825 he took classes in Anatomy and Surgery offered by John Barclay MD and the well known Robert Knox MD. Throughout 1926-1927 he studied the principles and Practice of Surgery and Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery under Alexander Monro (presumably Professor Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859) , as well as Institutions of Medicine given by Andrew Duncan, Chemistry given by Andrew Fyfe, and Chemistry and Pharmacy by Thomas Charles Hope. In 1827-1828 there were studies and practices in Pathological Anatomy, Midwifery, Surgery, Principles and Practice of Surgery, Operative Surgery (again under Robert Knox), Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Dietetics and Pharmacy (given by Andrew Duncan), Practical Anatomy, and Military Surgery (given by George Ballingall), as well as attendance at Anatomical Demonstrations. In 1829 he was studying Botany, and the Institutes of Medicine, and he was attending Clinical Lectures. In 1829 he was admitted to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1834 he studies Practical Chemistry and Pharmacy under William Gregory MD. There are undated cards showing study in the Junior Humanity class under James Pillans, and the prectice of Medicine under James Home. There are no cards showing studies after 1834. Thomas S. Brown may have attended Edinburgh Academy (at least between 1828-1829) prior to studying Medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1831 he was issued with a University Library card and that study year he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons Museum and he attended the Junior Humanity class offered by James Pillans, as well as the Chemistry and Pharmacy class given by Charles Hope. In 1832 he was admitted to classes in Mechanical Philosophy given by George Lees, Surgery given by John W. Turner, Materia Medica given by Robert Christison, Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery, and Anatomy and Physiology given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. In 1833 Brown was a pupil in the Laboratory of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh and he also attended Clinical Lectures in Surgery and Principles and Practice of Surgery given by John Lizars. Between 1833 and 1834 he attended classes in Institutions of Medicine given by John Fletcher, Midwifery given by John Thatcher, and Practical Anatomy and Operative Surgery given by Alexander Jardine Lizars. William B. Clark had studied Logic and Metaphysics under David Ritchie in November 1824.

The mathematician, statistician, writer, composer and musician, Alexander Craig Aitken, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 1 April 1895. He was of Scottish descent. He attended Otago Boys' High School from 1908 to 1912. On winning a university scholarship in 1912 he went on to study at the University of Otago in 1913, enrolling in Mathematics, French and Latin. Studies were cut short by the 1914-1918 War however and he enlisted in 1915 serving with the Otago Infantry. Aitken saw action in Gallipoli and Egypt, and he was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. After his hospitalisation, he returned to New Zealand in 1917. On the completion of his studies in 1920, Aitken became a school-teacher at Otago Boys' High School and the same year he married Winifred Betts the first lecturer in Botany at the University of Otago where he also did some tutoring. Then, encouraged by a professor of mathematics at the University, he gained a postgraduate scholarship which brought him to Edinburgh University in 1923. His thesis on statistics gained him the degree of D.Sc. in 1925 when he also joined the University staff as a lecturer in Statistics and Mathematical Economics. In 1937 he was promoted to Reader, and in 1946 was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Aitken's publications include: jointly with H. W. Turnbull,The theory of canonical matrices(1932); with D. E. Rutherford, a series of Mathematical Texts; wartime experiences inGallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand infantryman(1963); and, posthumouslyTo catch the spirit. The memoir of A.C. Aitken with a biographical introduction by P.C. Fenton(1995). He made many important contributions to the many fields of his subject, particularly in the theory of Matrix Algebra and its application to various branches of mathematics. In his time, Professor Aitken was one of the fastest mathematical calculators in the world. While at school, Aitken had learned to play the violin, and later on in life he played both the violin and viola and composed pieces for performance by university groups. Professor Alexander C. Aitken died in Edinburgh on 3 November 1967.

Russell A. Leather was born in 1924. He was educated at George Heriot's School and studied at Edinburgh University from 1948. His university education was delayed by wartime and his army service as a Captain in the Far East with the Royal Corps of Signals, 1942-1947/48. As in other instutions in the UK, studying at Edinburgh University in the immediate post-war period was challenging. Food and clothing were severely rationed and new equipment was in short supply. Test equipment and other mechanical machinery were of pre-war standard, but although out-dated it was capable of producing decent results. Although Leather studied electrical engineering, the first year curriculum was aimed at providing students with a broader engineering background. Mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology were all covered.  In the pre-war period, the emphasis had been on civil engineering but this changed in the late-1940s when, under Professor Arnold, greater emphasis was placed on mechanical engineering. And, later on, under Professor Farvis, an electrical engineering curriculum was developed and this included electronics which, though still hollow state, would soon be dominated by solid state electronics. At Edinburgh University, electrical power engineering relied on equipment at the then Heriot-Watt College. After his studies, Leather worked on and researched into radar with Ferranti in Edinburgh and in Dundee. During his time with Ferranti he took out around 25 patents. Latterly he was Chair of the Gannochy Trust for seventeen years until 2008, and had been a Trustee for 40-years. Russell A. Leather BSc Hon LL.D. CEng. FIEE MIMechE visited Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections, in November 2012 to donate his first and second year engineering note-books.

Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, in October 1854. He was the youngest son of Capt. Alexander Geddes, and he grew up in Perth where he was educated at Perth Academy. He then studied under Thomas Henry Huxley at the Royal School of Mines, London, 1874-1878. He also studied at University College, London, at the Sorbonne and at the University of Edinburgh and at Montpellier, France. Geddes succesively demonstrated or lectured in Physiology at University College, London, in Zoology at Edinburgh University from 1880 to 1888, and held the Chair of Botany at University College Dundee from 1888 to 1919. At the University of Bombay, India, he organised a department of sociology and civics and held the Chair of Sociology there from 1919 until 1924. Although trained in Biology, Geddes had generalist interests and these soon led him to become a social geographer, practical administrator, historian, dramatist and philosopher. He involved himself in the renovation movement in the Old Town of Edinburgh and it was in the Old Town too that he situated his famous Outlook Tower, a museum of local, regional, Scottish, and world history. In 1919, Geddes who was 'considered one of the greatest living authorities in civics and social survey' was entrusted by the International Zionist Commission to plan New Jerusalem and its proposed university. He was also the founder - in 1924 - of the College Des Ecossais (Scots College), an international teaching establishment located in Montpellier. In the British Mandated Territory (part of which later became Israel), the new city of Tel Aviv (the White City) was constructed from the early 1930s until the 1950s based on an urban plan by Sir Patrick Geddes - a plan which reflected modern organic planning principles. He was also involved in Indian town planning work. Publications by Patrick Geddes include:Chapters in modern botany,1893;City development : a study of parks, gardens, and culture institutes,1904;Cities in evolution : an introduction to the town planning movement and to the study of civics,1915;Leben und Werk von Sir Jagadis C. Bose,circa 1930; jointly with Sir J. Arthur Thomson,The evolution of sex,1889; and, jointly with Victor Verasis Branford,The coming polity: a study in reconstruction,1917, andOur social inheritance,1919. Geddes was knighted in 1932, and Sir Patrick Geddes died in Montpellier, France on April 17, 1932.

Thomson stresses the need for more investment and energy to be put into vocational education, looking to America as an example.  He emphasises the imbalance of educational investment between the average student versus the above average or the mentally impaired student, arguing that all 3 should receive the same investment, though the methods and curriculum may be different. He proposes the creation of secondary schools equipped for vocational training and apprenticeship, staffed by individuals trained in a trade, but also as teachers, to replace the current evening or day release classes. He gives examples from Germany and Britain of close liaison and co-operation between industry and educators, and cites the Air Training Corps and scheme of National Certificates as existing British foundations to build upon. Thomson argues that whatever education a student receives, it should be grounded in reality and their interests, and thus prepare them for work. He emphasises the need for career guidance for students and good methods of selection into trades, pleading the case that students' abilities and talents be considered throughout their school career rather than from a single test. He also stresses the need for information and individual tests to be made freely available in a centralised place to better facilitate students going into professions and vocations suited to their abilities and interests.

The Scottish judge, Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, was born around 1605 and was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall, first baronet. He studied for the legal profession, became an advocate, and was knighted in 1632. In 1640 he was placed on the Committee of Estates appointed to provide for the defence of the country against King Charles I (the Committee of Estates had been appointed to govern Scotland when Parliament was not in session). In 1651, his brother Sir Alexander Hope was examined by the Committee of Estates for advising the King to surrender Scotland and Ireland to Cromwell, during which he quoted Sir John, Lord Craighall, as having stated that the King should 'treat with Cromwell for one-half of his coat before he lost the whole'. In 1652, Sir John was appointed as one of three Scottish judges who, together with five English judges, comprised Cromwell's committee responsible for the administration of justice. Another brother, Sir James Hope (1614-1661), was a representative for Scotland in the English Parliament in 1653. Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall, died in Edinburgh on 28 April 1654. It had been Sir John Hope and Sir James Hope who in the 1660s had owned the lead-ore company at Leadhills in the Lowther Hills - an area along with Wanlockhead which yielded other ores too. Indeed gold was discovered in the area during the reign of James IV, when gold-mining had provided employment for 300 persons. Although gold-mining declined, the export of lead-ore from Leadhills was very important in the early modern Scottish economy, and the Hope family had built on their control of this industry to acquire property and land. The lead mines were profitable enough to justify building or improving roads the full 50 miles to Leith from which the ore could be exported to the Low Countries for smelting.

Thomson thanks Ledermann for his letter, and asks him to clarify some points for him. He refers to Thurstone's way of finding simple structure, and discusses reference vectors and primary factors at length.  Thomson also asks Ledermann if his post at St Andrews is coming to an end, and expresses regret that he cannot offer help to him. He asks Ledermann if he would mind reading part of his manuscript for the forthcoming edition of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability.  Also includes a postscript, referring to Ledermann's reciprocity of reference vectors and primary factors, and Thomson's puzzlement at the absence of a diagonal matrix in Ledermann's formulae, illustrated with several pages of notes and formulae.

The name David de Hasteville, in London, first appears in theCalendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I. 1640-41., p.377, in the 'Petition of David de Hasteville, formerly called Father Archange de Hasteville, Abbé du Val de Sainte Croix and General of the Order of St. Romuald to [Sec. Windebank]'. De Hasteville had recently become a Protestant and was seeking 'some sort of entertainment or pension'. He had also petitioned the House of Commons in 1648, describing himself as a Protestant who had recently left his native France and 'a plentiful estate'. Apparently in 1643 he had been appointed general of artillery under Sir William Waller, and had raised three hundred and fourteen men at his own cost, not receiving any government cash, and was then in danger of arrest for money owed for the billetting of his soldiers.

Hugh Blair FRSE (7 April 1718–27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse. As a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair's teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for Sermons, a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment  Blair's publishers were Thomas Becket or Beckett and Peter Abraham De Hondt James Macpherson was a Scottish writer, poet, literary collector and politician, known as the 'translator' of the Ossian cycle of poems. He was born on 27 October 1736. Blair had arranged the publication of Macpherson's Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland in 1760, and it was Macpherson's Fingal of 1761 that prompted Blair to deliver the lectures that he expanded into A critical dissertation on the poems of Ossian, the son of Fingal published by Becket and De Hondt in London. The same publisher brought out Macpherson's second and final Ossianic epic Temora. James Macpherson died 17 February 1796.

In Ledermann's letter to Thomson, dated 25 Apr 1939, he informs Thomson of his applying for the Carnegie Teaching Fellowship, which would allow him to undertake original research in the areas of pure matrix algebra and abstract group theory. He also mentions that he would like to devote some time to applied mathematics, specifically factor analysis, and asks Thomson for permission to continue the work he undertook as Thomson's assistant, perhaps with the help of Lawley. In Thomson's reply, dated 26 Apr 1939, he tells Ledermann how pleased he is at the possibility of Ledermann's teaching fellowship and of him continuing work on factor analysis.

Friedrich (Frederick) Niecks - son of an orchestral musician, teacher and conductor - was born in Duesseldorf, Germany, on 3 February 1845. He was educated privately in Duesseldorf and at the age of thirteen he made his first appearance as a violinist at a concert of the Musikverein in the city. Until 1868 he was a violinist and teacher of music, still in his home city, and then on the encouragement of the Scottish composer and conductor Alexander Mackenzie (1847-1935) he settled in Scotland where he played viola in Mackenzie's Edinburgh quartet. Niecks was also an organist and teacher of music in Dumfries. By 1875 he had begun writing music and contributing to music journals and between 1877 and 1878 he studied at Leipzig University. In 1880 he took British nationality. In 1891 Niecks became Reid Professor of Music, and Dean of the Faculty of Music, at Edinburgh University. In 1907 he married Christina Struthers. His publications includeA Concise Dictionary of musical terms(1884),Chopin as a man and musician(1888), andProgramme music in the last four centuries(1907), and Struthers edited hisRobert Schumannfor posthumous publication in 1925. He retired in 1914. Professor Frederick Niecks died on 24 June 1924.

Until the mid-19th century, broadsides provided the sort of information provided by modern tabloids. They tended to be single sheets of paper, unfolded, and printed on one side. Designed to be posted up in public places, broadsides were used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices, and later on became a means of political agitation. Edinburgh's 'baillies', the officials responsible for this notice or broadside, were the city's magistrates who had administrative and judicial powers. In Scotland the office of 'baillie', also spelled 'bailie', emerged in the 14th century. Since 1975, the title has largely become a courtesy one. Those baillies present when this ordinance was issued in Edinburgh in November 1720 were: John Wightman, George Preston, Robert Grierson, and Hugh Hathorn. They were present as Baillies and Justices of His Majesty's Peace. The ordinance was intended to restrain the soldiers of the City Guard from the 'immoral practices of Cursing and Swearing'. Those who were caught would be fined one penny and the money put into the poor box.

Beale first met the American biologist Tracy Sonneborn in 1947 at a summer symposium at Cold Spring Harbor, where Beale was working at the time. Sonneborn invited Beale to join his group at Indiana University, Bloomington, to work on the protozoan group Paramecium. Beale remained in Bloomington for nine months from October 1947, and would pay many subsequent visits, enjoying the congenial atmosphere and Sonneborn's company. Beale's work on Paramecium genetics would continue for many years throughout his career, as would his correspondence with Sonneborn. When Sonneborn died in 1981, Beale wrote his biographical memoir for the Royal Society.

This details the development of Hector's knowledge and intelligence, charting how he plays and learns day to day tasks; vocabulary he has acquired; performance in intelligence tests; personality traits; and general health and well-being. The diary reads as though it was compiled after observing Hector, rather than during, and contains information supplied by Lady Thomson and added by Thomson.

The main body of the collection is correspondence from Dr. James D. Macgregor to his family in Scotland (but also to/from others) from both Sierra Leone and the Solomon Islands. The letters are largely in aerogramme form but there are also letters in conventional form with the original stamped and franked envelopes, as well as illustrative postcards and occasional ephemera. The content of the correspondence is largely descriptive of the locations and the work involved there, and to a degree there is family-oriented correspondence. The collection is composed of:    
      Correspondence: c.197 letters from Sierra Leone, 1951-1957;
      Correspondence: c.613 letters from the Solomon Islands, 1957-1975;
      Tour reports to the Chief Secretary of the Western Pacific High Commission, 1960-1964;
      Police Medical/Postmortem Reports to the Sierra Leone Police, c.200 in number;
      Original book-file cover in which the Police Reports had been archived;
      Sierra Leone Protectorate Handbook, 1954.
    
In the material relating to Sierra Leone, 1953, are some programmes for the celebrations to be held at Makeni from 1-3 June 1953 in honour of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. There is also a poster from the 'Committee of Gentlemen' about the staging of a dance on 5 June 1954 to mark the 'forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitri' with music from the 'Famous Cuban Swing Band'. In the material relating to the Solomon Islands, there is a pamphlet about postal information issued by the Orient Line for the vessel SS Oronsay. Many of the early pieces of correspondence are written on Orient Line aerogrammes. An edited version of all Macgregor's letters are contained on a CD within the collection.

Thomson begins by emphasising the vital role that school education plays in civilised society. He takes the title of his talk from the H G Wells novel, to which he makes reference. The food of the gods he alludes to is both science and art, and he stresses the importance of both to a balanced civilisation where the two are united by the mastery of language. Thomson praises the school for the opportunities it provides for its pupils and the benefits in turn its pupils provide for their communities.

The lecture regards the problem of propaganda in school. Thomson defines what he sees as propaganda and its methods, and discusses whether teachers, who have an advantage over their less mature students, can avoid propaganda, and if so, how. He gives a few examples of controversial subjects that should or should not be covered in school. The lecture is on the one side of the manuscript, with the other containing a typescript of an incomplete poem regarding education and scholarship (it is unclear whether this was written by Thomson or copied); and a quotation from Bertrand Russell's Analysis of Matter with Thomson's comments.

Thomson argues that the British education system needs to make provision for vocational training, citing, in some detail, Germany's extensive system of vocational training as an example.  He stresses that the vocational training undertaken through the necessities of war should be carried on through peacetime, ensuring it is integrated into the existing educational system and valued, and outlines the history and decline of apprenticeship and vocational education in Britain between the 17th and 19th centuries.

James Geikie (1839-1915) was the leading British authority on Pleistocene geology, developing the theory that during ice-ages mild inter-glacial periods interrupted the glacial period as a whole. He originated the current belief that human habitation continued in Europe throughout the glacial period. Geikie undertook classes at the University of Edinburgh while working in a printer's office. In 1861 he took up a position, with the Geological Survey, mapping glacial drift deposits in Central Scotland. This was supervised by his brother Archibald Geikie (1835-1924) whom he succeeded as the second Murchison Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Edinburgh.

Poems of Alison Murray Oliver
|
The 'Field of Mars' (or Marsovo Polye) is a large park named after Mars - the Roman god of war - and situated in the centre of St. Petersburg, Russia. At the time of the city's founding in the 18th century, the site was called the 'Grand Meadow', and military solemnities in the honour of victory in the Great Northern War against Sweden were held there. Later, it was renamed 'Pleasure Field' (Poteshnoe Polye), and in the 1740s it was turned into a park with paths, lawn and flowers. When Rastrelli was commissioned to build a Summer Palace for Empress Catherine I, the field was again renamed, this time as 'Tsarina's Meadow'. By the end of the 18th century 'Tsarina's Meadow' became a military drilling ground, and monuments to Russian victories were erected there including one to Alexander Suvorov in 1801. It became known as the 'Field of Mars' in 1805.

Cargill Gilston Knott, the Scottish physicist, mathematician, and seismologist, was born in Penicuik on 30 June 1856. He was educated at Arbroath High School in Angus, and then he studied at Edinburgh University matriculating there first in 1872. Between 1872 and 1875 Knott studied courses in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Botany, Natural History, Chemistry and Practical Chemistry. He obtained the degree of B.Sc. in 1876 and then the degree of D.Sc. in 1879. His thesis was on researches in contact electricity. He was Tait's assistant in the Natural Philosophy class from 1879 until 1883. In the 1883 he became Professor of Physics and Engineering at the Imperial University of Japan until 1891. On his return to Edinburgh, Knott was Lecturer (1892-1920) then Reader (1920-1922) in Applied Mathematics at the University until his death. Cargill Gilston Knott died on 26 October 1922

J. L. Levison lived for a time in Hull, England. He was the author of Mental culture, or, The means of developing the human faculties, published in 1883, and printed for Levison and sold by Jackson and Walford, London, and also of Practical observations on the teeth and gums with the best means for their preservation published in 1838 by Longman, London.  George Combe was born in Edinburgh on 21 October 1788, the son of a brewer. He went to the parish school of St. Cuthberts in either 1794 or 1795, and then on to the Royal High School. Between 1802 and 1804 he attended classes at Edinburgh University. In 1815, through an article in the Edinburgh review, there was an attack on the phrenologists Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Spurzheim visited Edinburgh to defend himself through a series of lectures, and George Combe attended these becoming an ardent disciple and exponent in his own right. From 1818 he began writing and lecturing on phrenology, and in 1820 he formed the Phrenological Society and started the Phrenological journal. In spite of formal criticism of the science and arguments within the Society, by 1836, Combe had become a candidate for the Chair of Logic and Edinburgh University, though in the end his candidacy failed. Combe's publications included: Elements of phrenology (1824); System of phrenology (1825-1853); and, The constitution of man considered in relation to external objects (1828). George Combe died on 14 August 1858.

Letter :: [Koestler, Cynthia?]

William Baird possibly had an association with Dysart in Fife, Scotland, in the seventeenth century. Within the manuscript, in its first part, there are a number of clues that supply a date to his life and indicate the Scottish origin of the item. Under an explanation of the Dominical Letter system for discovering the day of the week corresponding to any date is included a mnemonic beginning, 'At Dysart dwells George Bronn Esquire'. The inclusion of this mnemonic suggests that Baird was engaged in teaching mathematics to others and that he was doing so in Scotland. In addition to the reference to Dysart, there is also mention of Scottish money - 'Lib Scotts' - and a date of 1676 is supplied in another calculation. Dysart is a small town on the River Forth, on the northern shore of its large estuary. Dating from the 13th century, the town established itself in the middle of the 15th century as a trading port, exporting salt and coal to the Low Countries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. It had been towards the end of the 16th century that the first coal pit in the town was sunk - known as Lady Blanche. By the middle of the 17th century when coal began to surpass the salt trade, two new pits followed - Frances and Randolph. Two hundred years later, in 2009, there was no coal trade and no salt trade, and the community was a suburb of Kirkcaldy.

The Corson Collection consists of materials assembled by James Clarkson Corson (1905-1988), Deputy Librarian of Edinburgh University and Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford.It is comprised of two sub-divisions. The first consists of materials related to Sir Walter Scott, including manuscripts, artworks, realia, memorabilia, press-cuttings, and critical materials, which were purposely collected by Corson to complement his extensive collection of printed works by or about Scott.The second consists of Corson's own papers. Most of these are connected to Corson's published and unpublished research on Sir Walter Scott. There are also, however, papers relating to his role as Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford (1952-1988), some personal and family papers, and the papers of critic and broadcaster William Saunders, for whom Corson appears to have acted as literary executor.

The article explores the uses of intelligence testing in determining mental defects in young children; examinations at 11 (eleven-plus) to determine the child's future schooling; and testing for the purpose of administering vocational guidance. Thomson examines each of these three uses in turn, citing examples of the use of intelligence tests in England and Scotland. He explores some of the problems of testing for selection to secondary school, in particular the possibility of coaching and the need to ensure a steady supply of new, standardised intelligence tests each year. He outlines the standard contents of Moray House Tests and the procedure of trialling the tests to establish their suitability as well as norms within and between age groups. He also touches upon the influence of level of schooling on intelligence test performance, as illustrated by an often negative correlation between age and intelligence within a school year group. Additionally, he describes experiments underway in Fife and London to establish the use of intelligence testing in vocational guidance.

Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, singer, pianist, folk-song collector and arranger, was born in 1857. She was the daughter of singer David Kennedy (1825-1886). Her series of works The songs of the Hebrides, published variously between 1909 and 1922 remain a useful resource for both Gaelic and English speakers. She collected songs chiefly in the Western Isles. Aware that the material collected would, in the concert performance, lose something of the original essence, she provided the songs with sensitive accompaniment. For service rendered to the cause of music in Scotland, an honorary degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on her in 1928. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser had also been awarded the C.B.E. She died on 22 November 1930.

John Smith Flett was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, on 26 June 1869. He was educated at Kirkwall Burgh School and at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. In 1886 he entered Edinburgh University studying Arts, Science, and Medicine, and was awarded the degree of M.A. at the age of nineteen, the degree of B.Sc. in 1892, and the degrees of M.B. and C.M. (Master in Surgery) in 1894. A brief spell in medical practice followed, before he joined the staff of the Geology Department of Edinburgh University as Assistant to Professor James Geikie (1839-1915), and then as a Lecturer in Petrology. Flett's earliest noteworthy research was his investigations into the stratigraphy of the Old Red Sandstone of Orkney and into the petrography of the alkaline dykes found in that formation. For this Orkney research he was awarded the degree of D.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1900, and that year too he became Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1901, Flett took up the post of Petrographer to the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and acquired a comprehensive knowledge of British rocks. Whilst in post, he collaborated with Dr. Tempest Anderson (1846-1913) in studying the vulcanicity of the Soufriere and Mont Pelee in the West Indies. In 1911 he became Assistant to the Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and during the First World War he was responsible for the supply of geological information required. In 1918, Flett was appointed OBE and was awarded the KBE in 1925. Towards the end of his career, Flett was responsible for the transfer of the Geological Survey to the Geological Museum at South Kensington, in 1935. His published works include a collaborative piece,James Geikie: the man and the geologist(1917) as well asThe first hundred years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1835-1935(1937). Sir John Smith Flett died at Ashdon, in Essex, on 26 January 1947.

The lawyer, soldier and academic Thomas Broun Smith was born on 3 December 1915. He was the son of J. Smith, DL. JP, and Agnes Smith, of Symington, Lanarkshire. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow, and at Sedbergh School, and then he studied at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was awarded a First Class Honours degree, an MA, in 1937, and an Eldon Scholarship. Smith was called to the English Bar (Gray's Inn) in 1938. Prior to his call to the Bar, he had signed up with the Territorial Army in 1937, and so his period as a pupil in chambers was cut short by the start of war in 1939 and active service. During the Second World War he served with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and with the Home Forces, and he was in the Middle East and the Central Mediterranean. He took part in the retreat to Dunkirk. By 1945 he was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Gordon Highlanders and had been mentioned in despatches. Between 1946 and 1947 he had been attached to the Foreign Office. During the war, in 1940, he had married Ann Dorothea Tindall of Exmouth in Devon. Smith had been admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland in 1947, taking silk in 1953. In 1949 he was appointed to the Chair of Scots Law at Aberdeen University where he was twice Dean of the Faculty of Law. He was awarded a DCL (Oxford) in 1956. Then, in 1958 Professor Thomas Broun Smith Q.C., D.C.L. was appointed to the Chair of Civil (Roman Law) at Edinburgh University in succession to Professor M. G. Fisher who retired in September 1958. Also in 1958 he became the first Scots lawyer to be elected a Fellow of the British Academy. Between 1954 and 1970 he was a member of the Scottish Law Reform Committee. Professor Smith was awarded a LL.D (Edinburgh) in 1963, and he was also awarded an Honorary LL.D (Cape Town), and honorary degrees from Glasgow and Aberdeen. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1981 in recognition of his services to the Law of Scotland. His publications included: Doctrines of judicial precedent in Scots Law (1952), The development of the laws and constitution of Scotland (1955), British Justice: The Scottish contribution (1961), A short commentary on the law of Scotland (1962), Property problesm in sale (1978), and Basic rights and their enforcement (1979). Sir Thomas Broun Smith, QC, FBA, FRSE died on 15 October 1988.

George Baillie was born on 16 March 1664. He was the son of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood and, through his mother Rachel, grandson of Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston, Edinburgh, Lord Warriston in the Cromwellian Parliament.Baillie's father was executed in 1684 on a charge of complicity in the Rye House plot, and after the execution the younger Baillie fled to Holland with his father's political associate, Sir Patrick Hume, who later became the 1st Earl of Marchmont. When William of Orange ascended the throne, Baillie returned to Scotland and played a prominent role as a leader of the Squadrone, whose votes gave the Act of Union a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Earlier, in September 1691 he married Grisell, the daughter of Sir Patrick Hume.He served in the Scottish Parliament as MP for Berwickshire, 1693-1698, and 1700-1701, and MP for Lanarkshire 1703-1707. Then in the British Parliament he served as a Lord Commissioner of Trade, 1710-1712, as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, 1714-1717, and as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, 1717-1725.Between May 1731 and October 1733, Baillie spent time in Italy with his wife. In 1734 he stood down from his Parliamentary career, and on 6 August 1738 he died.

In the first letter, dated 13 Mar 1928 and numbered 17 (38), Thomson discusses the work of M S Bartlett, in particular that the assumptions he makes about each person's ability in the unknown quality e will average zero over a number of persons. He refers to specification equations, and his trouble with them, in particular that they are true for all persons, using Robinson Crusoe as an analogy to show the problems with this premise. Ledermann has made brief marginal notes highlighting passages he agrees or disagrees with. In the second letter, dated 20 Mar 1938 and numbered 17a (38), Thomson states that he was dissatisfied with his previous letter, but having had no time to attend to it he has enclosed it and sent it as it is. He informs Ledermann that he will meet him in London, and encourages Ledermann to stay in London for as long as he wants. He refers briefly to Ledermann's correspondence with Paul Horst, as well as Thurstone's iterative process for finding commonalities.

Dr. George Firth was born on 27 February 1901. He was, successively, a scientist, professional singer, teacher, choral and orchestral conductor, lecturer, administrator and author. Access to Tovey's Essays in musical analysis encouraged him to leave his freelance singing career and study for a B.Mus. degree and then the degree of D.Mus. During army service Firth rose to the rank of Major and became Head of the Arts Department at Newbattle Abbey near Edinburgh. In 1955, Firth was awarded the O.B.E. for services to music in Scotland.  Dr. George Firth died on 22 May 1983.

On 18 July 1950, Sang and several colleagues wrote a letter to C.H Waddington, outlining their concerns about perceived bias or favouritism in matters of staff promotions and various administrative malpractices within the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation. W.K Slater, secretary of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), met with those concerned, after which he requested Sang and his colleagues to apologise to Waddington for their lack of faith in his direction and to tear up the letter which they had written. Sang agreed to this. However, by September he had written to W.G Alexander of the ARC complaining of the 'malpractices, maladministration and misuse of public property which has occurred in the Genetics Laboratory' and requesting that an 'official, and quasi-judicial enquiry' be carried out. He subsequently composed a memorandum, dated 14 September 1950, addressed to the ARC detailing the entire situation and again requesting a judicial enquiry. The resulting ARC enquiry 'into certain administrative matters connected with the Genetics Laboratory', took place in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, from 11-13 October 1950 and was chaired by Slater. The outcome of the enquiry was that the Genetics Laboratory was 'reorganised', with Sang moving to a laboratory within the Poultry Research Centre under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Waddington ceased to be employed by the ARC but instead became a full-time employee of the University, maintaining a dual position as Buchanan Professor and director of the Department of Animal Genetics.

The lecture outlines how science can fulfil its main purpose, in Thomson's opinion, that of uniting society. Thomson describes his own education – both formal and informal – and his current role as a lecturer in education, and explains how these have informed his beliefs regarding scientific training.  He makes the case that science has often operated in isolation both from the world around it, and from the native language of its practitioners, with science students dependant on the language of symbols and formulae and incapable, or unwilling, to render their ideas into English.  He stresses the importance that science should be taught in such a way as to enable the student to see its relevance to the wider world and to culture; and the importance that students are not taught to simply accept hypothesis and formula without understanding or questioning.

This undated letter from John Donaldson to H. H. Dibdin, and written from Marchfield, discusses the adjustment and tuning of an organ, and denies that Sir George Clerk had advocated 'the absurd perfect third system' stating, 'Until the valves were equally opened it was quite impossible to know, precisely, what kind of temperament Mr. Hill had adopted for the Music Hall organ. When I tried it with Sir G. Clerk we found one stop in tolerable tune - I say tolerable, but even in that stop many of the octaves were out of tune rendering it impossible to do more than conjecture as to the temperament intended'. Donaldson goes on to suggest that Hill would be the right person to carry out any alterations to the instrument, and comments on attitudes to equal temperament.

Auerbach goes on to say that, having adopted Scotland as her new home country, she does not want to confuse her feelings by trying to rebuild connections with Germany. Mothes' reply is disappointed, though sympathetic. Also present is a letter to Auerbach from Paula Hertwig asking her to reconsider her decision, and inviting her to visit her at the Martin Luther University, Halle-Wittenberg.

George Chalmers was born in Fochabers, in Moray, in 1742, and was educated in Fochabers and at King's College, Aberdeen. He studied Law at Edinburgh University. At the age of twenty-one he travelled with his uncle to America, to Maryland, and he practised law in Baltimore. On the outbreak of the American Civil War he returned to Britain, settling in London in 1775 where he began writing chiefly on political and colonial matters. In 1786 he was appointed to the Board of Trade as 'chief clerk of the committee of privy council for trade and foreign plantations'. He then turned to writing biography, publishing on Daniel Defoe, Thomas Paine and Thomas Ruddiman (Scottish grammarian and printer). In the 1800s he turned to the poetry and history of Scotland publishing poems of Allan Ramsay and Sir David Lyndsay. His works included: Annals of the present United Colonies (1780), Three tracts on Ireland (1785), Life of Daniel De Foe (1786), The poems of Allan Ramsay, with a Life of the author (1800), Caledonia starting in 1807, and Life of Mary Queen of Scots, drawn from the State Papers, with six subsidiary memoirs (1818). George Chalmers died on 31 May 1825.

The Board of Ordnance was a British government body responsible for the supply of armaments and munitions to the Royal Navy (until 1830) and British Army. It was also responsible for providing artillery trains for armies and maintaining coastal fortresses and, later, management of the artillery and engineer corps. It also produced maps for military purposes, a function later taken over by the Ordnance Survey. The board existed under various names from 1414 until 1855, with headquarters in the Tower of London.

James Scott Robson was born in Hawick on 19 May 1921, the son of William Scott Robson and Elizabeth Hannah Watt. He was educated at Hawick High School and began studies at Edinburgh University in 1939 graduating in 1944 with the degree of MD., and then in 1945 with the degrees of MB ChB. Earlier, in 1942, he had been awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Studentship and travelled to the USA to complete his medical training. From 1945 to 1948 Robson served as a Captain with the Royal Army Medical Corps in India, Palestine and Egypt, and then in 1948 he married Mary Kynoch Macdonald. On demobilisation from military service he worked for a brief period with Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Clinical Chemistry Laboratories teaching medical students and postgraduate doctors, and researching kidney function and looking at patients with disturbances of water and electrolyte balance. In 1949 however, he was awarded a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship and he again travelled to the USA to the Department of Nutrition and Biochemistry, Harvard. In 1950 he was back in Edinburgh and with Hugh Dudley (born 1925) he set up a treatment centre for acute reversible renal failure, and with his wife, the pathologist Dr. Mary MacDonald, the Edinburgh renal biopsy service was established. This groundwork led to the first successful kidney transplant operation in the UK, performed in 1960 by Professor Sir Michael Woodruff at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Robson became Reader in Therapeutics at Edinburgh University in 1961, Reader in Medicine in 1969, and Professor of Medicine in 1977. He played a prominent role in the revision and modernisation of the Edinburgh University undergraduate medical curriculum. The nephrologist James Scott Robson, Emeritus Professor of Medicine, died in Edinburgh on 14 March 2010

Autograph letter signed to the Editor of the Scotsman newspaper, 3 pages 8vo, written at Allerly, Melrose, on writing paper of Edinburgh University, and dated 5 November 1867. The letter, which is either an autograph draft or an edited version prepared for publication, condemns the forgery by Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1880) of letters of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Denis Vrain-Lucas was one of the most notorious forgers of the nineteenth century. His forged letters of Newton and Pascal were sold to one Michel Chasles in 1861. Brewster writes that he is glad to see in the Scotsman the opinions of Professor Kelland and Professor Tait on the letters of Pascal and Newton. The forgery of the letters he writes, 'is proved by every variety of evidence internal, and external, direct and circumstantial, and not a single fact or argument has been produced to prove that they are authentic'.

The letter from Christison, 40 Moray Place [ Edinburgh], Monday 4 August [1862], to David Cousin of the City Chambers, refers to a 'long report' read by Dr. Bennett, on the Buildings Committee of the University. The report referred to how 'a careful survey' found the buildings were 'in a condition of great disrepair'. With regard to this, Christison had found, as 'Convenor of Finance', that he had 'a sum of £300' available in the general accounts, and explained that since Dr. Bennett and the 'other members of the Buildings Committee' were in London, and he had been 'suddenly substituted', but had been 'at last floored and in bed' with an illness, he was sure that 'a few minutes of conversation' would enable him to empower Cousin 'to proceed'. The letter then refers to how he had followed the example of his colleagues and had accordingly arranged to leave town for Dumfriesshire from the following Monday and would stay there for ten days.

Lewis T. Waters from Maryland, USA, studied and researched at Edinburgh University in the 1960s. He was awarded the degree of Ph.D (Edinburgh) in 1970 for his thesis entitled Urban form systems in physical planning: a case study of Cumbernauld. During the course of his research, and with relevance to a portion of his thesis, he found some correspondence between Sir Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) and Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) particularly interesting. The material had been passed to him by Arthur Geddes, the younger son of Sir Patrick Geddes. Patrick Geddes was born in Ballater, Aberdeenshire on 2 October 1854. He was educated at Perth Academy and then studied at the Royal College of Mines in London, 1874-1878. He lectured in Zoology at Edinburgh University, 1880-1888. He held the Chair of Botany at University College, Dundee, from 1888 to 1919, and the Chair of Sociology at the University of Bombay from 1919 to 1924. Geddes was actively occupied in city improvement, town planning, and educational initiatives at home, on the continent, and in India. He drew up a city plan for both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and he developed the Cite Universitaire Mediterraneanne (College des Ecossais) at Montpellier, France, and the educational facility at the Outlook Tower, Edinburgh.  Geddes was knighted in 1932. His publications included: Evolution of sex, with Sir J. Arthur Thomson; Cities in evolution; and The life and work of Sir Jagadis C. Bose. Sir Patrick Geddes died in France, at Montpellier, on 17 April 1932. Geddes was an influence on several British urban planners, notably Raymond Unwin. Raymond Unwin was born on 2 November 1863. He was the younger son of William Unwin of Balliol College, Oxford. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and then he trained in engineering and architecture, and practised as an architect from 1896. He laid out schemes such as: New Earswick, York; Letchworth; and, Hampstead Garden Suburb. From 1911 to 1914 he was a special Lecturer in Town Planning at Birmingham University. In 1914 he became Chief Town Planning Inspector, Local Government Board, and during the War he was Director of the Housing Branch, Ministry of Munitions. After the War, he was Chief Architect, Housing, at the Ministry of Health, and he served on several Departmental Committees dealing with housing and town planning matters. He was Chief Advisor to Greater London Regional Town Planning Committee, 1929-1933. Unwin was knighted in 1932.

The site on the lower left right hand side of the street (not visible) was formerly occupied by a Bus Depot and, before that, by the Edinburgh Gas Works. The building on the immediate right is probably the house, or site of the house, of Lord Kames (see Chambers' 'Traditions of Edinburgh', Chapter on the Canongate, page 300, 1947 edition).

The Coronation of the British monarch King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra took place in Westminster Abbey (the Abbey Church of St. Peter), London, on Thursday 26 June 1902. He was the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Edward's mother Queen Victoria had died eighteen months earlier at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901. Edward, or Albert Edward, or Bertie, was born at Buckingham Palace, London, on 9 November 1841. His wife, Queen Alexandra was a Princess of Denmark, elder daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. They were married at St. George's Chapel, Windsor on 10 March 1863. Before the death of his mother and his own accession to the throne, Edward held the title of Prince of Wales. No-one since Edward has been heir apparent to the throne for a longer period. During his reign, now called the Edwardian period, the office of the Prime Minister saw its first official recognition. Edward VII was the first British monarch to visit Russia. This happened in 1908. He had also assisted in modernising the British Home Fleet. His interest in seafaring and the Navy earned him the name of 'Sailor King'. Edward VII reigned from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May 1910.

Poet, essayist, literary critic, historian, and social commentator, Christopher Murray Grieve, also known as Hugh MacDiarmid, was born on 11 August 1892 in Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy then at Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh prior to studying at Edinburgh University. After wartime service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1915-20, in Salonika, Italy, and France, he became a journalist in Montrose, Angus. There he worked for theMontrose Reviewand edited three issues of the first post-war Scottish verse anthologyNorthern Numbers(1921-23). In 1922 he founded the journalScottish Chapbook, advocating the revival of Scottish literature. Grieve was a Labour member of Montrose town council from 1923, but in 1928 he was one of the founder members of the National Party of Scotland (now the Scottish National Party). Later on however he came to accept Marxist philosophy. He was a formal member of the Communist Party from 1934 until 1938 when he was expelled, and rejoined in 1957. Indeed, in 1964 he was a defeated Communist candidate opposing Sir Alec Douglas-Home in a Perthshire constituency in the General Election. In 1929, he worked onVoxin London, and in 1930 was living in Liverpool, working as a public relations officer. Another spell in London followed. In 1933 Grieve moved to Whalsay in the Shetland Islands, staying there until 1941. In these wartime years, he worked as a manual labourer on Clydeside, 1941-43, and then on British merchant ships engaged in estuarial duties, 1943-45. After the Second World War, he lived in Glasgow, Strathaven in Lanarkshire, and then from 1951 in Biggar on the upper Clyde. As a poet, Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) was the pre-eminent Scottish figure in the first half of the 20th century, and was the leader of the Scottish literary renaissance. Indeed, he has been acknowledged as the greatest Scottish poet since Robert Burns. Grieve rejected English as a medium and wrote in an amalgam of various Scots dialects. Later on he wrote Scotticised English, and then returned to Standard English. His poetic work in these mediums, and under the pseudonym Hugh MacDiarmid, includedA drunk man looks at the thistle(1926),To Circumjack Cencrastus(1930),First hymn to Lenin(1931),Scots unbound(1932),Stony limits(1934),Second hymn to Lenin(1935),A kist of whistles(1947), andIn memoriam James Joyce(1955). Other works includeThe kind of poetry I want(1961),The company I've kept(1966),Celtic nationalism(1968),A lap of honour(1969),Song of the Seraphion(1973), andJohn Knox(1976). These titles represent only a very small proportion of Grieve's enormous output as poet, prose writer, editor, and translator. Grieve was writing well into the 1970s but died of cancer in Edinburgh on 9 September 1978.

The honorary degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on Charlotte Auerbach at this ceremony on 10 June 1977.
|
Charlotte Auerbach first met Hermann Joseph Muller when he arrived at the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1938. He was to remain at the Institute before 1940 before returning to the United States. His presence at the Institute had a profound influence on many workers there at that time, particularly Auerbach, who said 'Never have I met anybody who combined such penetrating analytical powers with such a breadth and depth of scientific imagination; nor anybody who combined such an absolute rejection of any type of supernatural belief with such a passionate and visonary belief in the perfectability of the human species and of the geneticists' responsibility to work towards this end.'
|
The chapter was initially to be published published in Implications and Potentials of Reproductive Biotechnology, edited by Philip Dziuk, E.J.C. Polge and J.M. Robl, although it eventually appeared in Animal Reproduction Science, Volume 79, Issues 3-4 (15 December 2003).

The divine and poet Ralph Erskine was born on 15 March 1685 at Monilaws in Northumberland. He was the sixth son of the Rev. Henry Erskine (1624-1696) by his second wife Margaret Halcro. Henry Erskine had settled in Northumberland in 1684 after a period of imprisonment on the Bass Rock. Ralph Erskine entered Edinburgh University in November 1699 studying an Arts course until 1704. Strongly religious as a child and influenced in young adulthood by the religious conversion of his sister-in-law who had married his brother Ebenezer Erskine (1680-1754), he himself became converted. After University he became tutor to the family of Colonel John Erskine of Culross, and he also pursued theological studies. In 1709 he was licensed by the Dunfermline Presbytery and was ordained in 1711. After a dispute with General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1732, Erskine along with six other ministers formed the Scottish Secession Church with Ebenezer Erskine as their first Moderator. In the late-1730s correspondence was begun between Erskine and George Whitefield (1714-1770) the Anglican cleric and evangelist who had gone to North America. The correspondence led to Whitefield coming to Scotland and his first sermon in Scotland was delivered at Erskine's own church. It wasn't too long before Erskine's Secession Church was torn in two - over the taking of the Civil Oath by Burgesses in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth. The argument was over what was meant in taking that Oath and over what it meant by promising to oppose Catholicism. Those who opposed the Oath withdrew in 1747 and constituted themselves as the General Associate Synod. Ralph Erskine is responsible for the following works: Gospel sonnets published early in his ministry and reaching a 10th edition in 1762 and a 25th in 1797 long after his death; a paraphrase of the Song of Solomon (1738); a version of the Book of Lamentations (1750). Job's hymns was published posthumously in in 1753. His Practical works in two volumes were edited by John Newlands, his son-in-law in 1764-1766. In the 1750s, Erskine developed heart disease and his last sermon was held in late-October 1752. Ralph Erskine died on 6 November 1752, and he was buried in Dunfermline on 9 November.

In the lecture, Thomson defends the use of examinations, arguing that they are preferable to nepotism. In addition, he identifies the problems of examinations, and how these may or have been resolved, including those of reliability and continuity of standards.  Thomson discusses the merits of internal versus external examination, giving examples from Scotland, England and Germany, and referencing some of his own experience both as a member of a School Certificate Examination Board and as an examination candidate himself, including his meeting aged 17 with Silvanus Thompson, who was one of his examiners from the London external B. Sc. Also includes a set of rough notes regarding the speech, with notes regarding sociological research in the British colonies.

Thomson tells Ledermann how glad he would be if, on leaving the University of St Andrews, he would take Lawley's vacated post. He makes him aware of the disadvantages of the post, in particular that it relies on a fund and as such is not permanent, and that would be an unconventional route from which to apply for possible future mathematics lectureships. He also states Emmett's pleasure at the possibility of working with Ledermann.

Papers of Richard Alan Beatty

Hamish Henderson was Scotland's leading folklorist, as well as a major poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist. He was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. His mother was Janet Jobson Henderson (d. 1933), a cook and housekeeper who had served as a nurse on the western front, and his father was James Scott (1874–1934), an army officer. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian, Jacobite maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. He also spent time in Dundee, Somerset, and Devon. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. In the world of the 1930s, the Depression, the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, and Scottish nationalism at home, would each shape Henderson's worldview and political outlook. When war broke out in September 1939, Henderson attempted to enlist in the Cameron Highlanders but he was rejected because of weak eyesight. He was called up the following year, joining the pioneer corps. However, with a gift for languages, he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer in January 1942, and served in north Africa with the Eighth Army. His service in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily.  During 1947 and 1948 he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. And, over and over again, Henderson's writings displayed a keen and deep appreciation of internationalism, foreign literature, and people's culture. Throughout his life too, he corresponded privately connecting with many of the finest minds of the day, and also wrote through the columns of national newspapers. Towards the end of the 1950s, on 15 May 1959, Henderson married Renate Felicitas (Kätzel) Schmidt (b. 1937) in Coburg, Germany Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene too. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002.

The bibliographer Edward Gordon Duff was born in Liverpool on 16 February 1863. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and then studied at Wadham College, Oxford, from 1883, taking a degree in Classics in 1887. At Oxford he drew up a catalogue of the 15th century books in the Bodleian Library, but further avenues did not open up for him in that direction so in 1889 he began to read for the Bar. In 1893, Duff was appointed by Mrs Rylands as her librarian with the task of cataloguing her books (including the Spencer library), advising on new purchases, organising the collection, and supervising its transfer to the new John Rylands Library in Manchester. He was also Sanders Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge, and President of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society.  Duff's works include Early Printed Books (1893), Early English Printing (1896), The Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476 to 1535 (1906), The English Provincial Printers, Stationers and Bookbinders to 1557 (1912), A Century of the English Book Trade, 1457–1557 (1905), and Fifteenth Century English Books (1917). Edward Gordon Duff died on 28 September 1924.

James Griffith Macaskie was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed on 1 December 1856. He was the third son of George Macaskie. James attended Berwick Grammar School and then went to Edinburgh to study at the School of Medicine, Surgeon's Hall. He lived with his uncle, Dr. J. Cochran, and he assisted at the Apothecary of a relative in the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. He was awarded a Bronze Medal for Physiology (Second Prize) while at Surgeon's Hall and was given a set of surgical instruments. He completed his studies at the young age of 21, and became an assistant to Dr. Crompton in Bury, Lancashire, before qualifying in 1878 - Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh) LRCS, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh) LRCP. Macaskie registered in England on 20 September 1878. In 1880, Macaskie became an assistant to Dr. Lewis G. Broadbent MD in Bamburgh, Northumberland, and became a practice partner in 1883. With his prospects secure, he married Marianne Kidd, daughter of a Tynemouth solicitor. In 1890 he took examinations in Edinburgh for the Diploma in Public Health (DPH Glasgow). On the retiral of Dr. Broadbent in 1891, Macaskie took up residence in the Doctor's House (thus also taking on the free Dispensary at Bamburgh Castle supported by the Lord Crewe Charity). During the Great War of 1914-1918, two of Macaskie's sons served with the RMC in Egypt and India, and a third was Commissioned in 1918 and served in France. That son died in 1924 due to ill-health acquired during the War. Macaskie retired in 1927 and he moved to Harrogate to be close to a brother. On the death of that brother, he returned To Northumberland, to Seahouses, in 1936. Dr. James Griffiths Macaskie died on 3 January 1945.

In a letter to the Ford Foundation on 20 January 1977, Beatty gave his reasons for deciding to withdraw from the Centre: 'It has recently become apparent that the projected completion date for the Reproductive Biology Building will be late 1979 or early 1980. I retire in April 1980 and it no longer makes sense for me to think of moving into the new building. It would be more realistic for me to withdraw now and make way for the finding of some alternative group to occupy the accommodation earmarked for me.'

Thomson outlines how the lecturer can gain, maintain, and regain the interest of their students. Drawing parallels with musical composition and form, he covers topics such as including building up anticipation through the use of foreshadowing, matching the pace of the lecture to pupils' skill levels, and presenting new aspects of mundane topics.  Thomson outlines the importance of an introductory section to engage students' attention and set the tone of the lesson.

William Saunders was born in Banff in 1743 and was a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School, studying under Cullen, and became a key figure in the history of medicine in the late-18th century. After graduation with the degree of MD - thesis De Antimonio in 1765 he moved to London to work for Sir George Baker (1722-1809) focussing at first on chemical investigations into 'Devonshire Colic'. He would reveal that the condition was caused by the presence of lead in the cider manufacturing process. In 1770 Baker recommended the appointment of Saunders to lecture at the newly formed medical school at Guy's, London. There he delivered the institution's first programme of lectures on the theory and practice of medicine. He remained at Guy's until 1802, and in 1807 he became physician to the Prince Regent. William Saunders retired from practice in 1814, and he died on 29 May 1817 at Enfield.

The composer (Jakob Ludwig) Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) was born on 3 February 1809 in Hamburg. Already as a boy he was writing music with skill and maturity. He first studied with his mother, and then studied in Berlin with various teachers, and then in Paris. HisOverture to a Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1826 when he was seventeen. In the early 1830s he travelled widely in Europe and hisHebridesoverture was inspired by a visit to Scotland in 1829. Mendelssohn was the favourite composer of Queen Victoria and hisScottish Symphonyis dedicated to her. Mendelssohn became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1835, and he founded the Leipzig conservatory of music in 1843. Both he and Robert Schumann taught there. Felix Mendelssohn died in Leipzig on 4 November 1847. The Scottish composer John Thomson (1805-1841) was the first Reid Professor of Music Theory at Edinburgh University. Thomson was well acquainted with Mendelssohn having first met him in Edinburgh in 1829. He renewed his contact with the composer later in Berlin and elsewhere on the continent, also making the acquaintance of Schumann.

In 1903 Dr. Arthur Logan Turner (1865-1939) became an Assistant Surgeon at the Ear and Throat Department at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. By 1906, he was a Surgeon, and then in 1921, a Surgeon-Consultant. In 1924, he became Consultant Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary and at Deaconess Hospital in Edinburgh. He was also a Lecturer in Diseases of the Larynx, Ear and Nose at Edinburgh University from 1906 to 1924. It was during this period in Turner's career that the lecture notes in this collection were written by an unknown student.

Jay Laurence Lush, the pioneering animal geneticist, was born on 3 January 1896 in Shambaugh, Iowa, United States of America. He studied the B.Sc. course in Animal Husbandry at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University, or KSU), and after obtaining the degree in 1916 he was awarded his M.Sc. at KSU in 1918, and then a Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1922. Between 1930 and 1966, Lush was the Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture at Iowa State University, and he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1967. He was awarded the US National Medal of Science in 1968, and the Wolf Prize in 1979. Lush visited Britain and Australia in 1948 on temporary duty with the US Department of State. Lush's influence on animal breeding around the world has been enhanced greatly by the wide distribution of his work Animal Breeding Plans (1937). In addition, his authoritative mimeographed notes, The genetics of populations (1948), have also played a major role in the thinking of animal breeders. Professor Jay L. Lush died on 22 May 1982.

The letter is said to be a forgery of a letter from Robert Burns to Edinburgh engraver James Johnson by forger Alexander Howland 'Antique' Smith. Smith was responsible for forgeries of letters not only by Robert Burns but by Sir Walter Scott and Mary Stuart and many prominent historical figures. He had earned the nickname 'Antique' Smith from his interest in old documents and ephemera. Smith appeared in the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh, on 26 June 1893 charged with selling and pawning spurious manuscripts as genuine, obtaining money by pretending that certain documents were genuine and not what they purported to be, and by offering false stories as to the origin of documents and manuscripts when knowing them to be false. The circulation of forgeries came to light the previous November in an article in theEdinburgh Evening Dispatch. Facsimiles of the forgers notes had been included in the article and a reader recognised the handwriting as that of a copying clerk working in various Edinburgh law offices - the clerk was 'Antique' Smith. Smith's explanation was that while in employment with the firm of Thomas Henry Ferrier WS as chief clerk he had been asked to get rid of a huge quantity of old documents that had accumulated in the cellars of the law office. On examining these he had found that many of the documents were of value and so he had begun selling them to booksellers, auction rooms and pawnbrokers. When the original stock ran out he had then provided fakes to replace them, and he claimed that he was able to supply any type of document required. Smith - the one and only mass-producer of literary forgeries in Scottish history - was found guilty on all charges but leniency was recommended. He was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

The lecture explores how schools could, and should, benefit the whole community by giving pupils a happy, clean environment which serves as a model for what the home should be, and by giving them the knowledge and skills in order to work towards solving practical and social problems in their communities.  He illustrates this point with detailed descriptions of the Rachel MacMillan Nursery School in Deptford, London, and the Training School for Village Teachers at Chapra, Bengal. The former, Thomson argues, demonstrates a happy, clean environment for 350 young children while the latter represents an ambitious attempt to train teachers to act as broader welfare workers to improve conditions for entire village communities.

In this scene (Coll-1167/PSE/A/1), the Esplanade probably had a gravel surface, hence the visible effects of rain. It was used as a parade ground for the garrison of the Castle, which, until the erection of the Redford Barracks (completed 1915), was the principal military location in the Edinburgh district. Note the tarmacadam road, bounded by the bollards in front, which encircles the ground. Note that this print and the next four, (to Coll-1167/PSE/A/5), do not show the Scottish National War Memorial, built 1924-27 in the reconstructed North Barracks, ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam and Walker).

Alexander Crum Brown was born on 26 March 1838. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Mill Hill School, and he studied at the Universities of Edinburgh, Heidleberg and Marburg. He was an extra-academical Lecturer in Chemistry at the University, 1863-1869. Professor Crum Brown, as he was known, was one of the greatest holders of the University of Edinburgh's Chair of Chemistry, from 1869. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although kindly and popular he struggled to keep control of some rather riotous classes. He retired in 1908. Crum Brown was President of the Chemical Society of London, 1893-1893. Professor Alexander Crum Brown died on 28 October 1922. George Burns obtained a B.Sc. from Edinburgh University in 1896.

Timothy Lauro Squire Sprigge was born in London on 14 January 1932. His father, Cecil Jackson Squire Sprigge (1896-1959), was the chief correspondent for Reuters in Italy between 1943 and 1953. The elder Sprigge translated some of the work of Benedetto Croce, the Italian philosopher, and also wrote biographies of Croce and Karl Marx. The younger Sprigge attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, between 1952 and 1959. He had studied English and then transferred to Moral Sciences. He spent the last two years of his studies and research for a Cambridge Ph.D. at University College London (UCL) where in 1959 he worked on the manuscripts of Jeremy Bentham. In 1961 he submitted his dissertation entitledThe limits of morals definedand was awarded the degree of Ph.D. (Cantab). On 4 April 1959, Sprigge married Giglia Gordon. In 1961 Sprigge took up a post as a temporary Lecturer in Philosophy at UCL, and later on in the 1960s was a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Sussex where he became Reader in 1970. From 1979 and for the next ten years he held the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh. Between 1989 and 1997 he was Emeritus Professor at Edinburgh University, and Endowment Fellow. After 1997 he was Emeritus Professor and Honorary Fellow. Sprigge was President of the Aristotelian Society, 1991-1992, and in 1993 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His publications include:Facts, words and beliefs(1970),Santayana: an examination of his philosophy(1974),The vindication of absolute idealism(1983),The rational foundations of ethics(1987),James and Bradley: American truth and British reality(1993), and, as Advisory Editor,Metaphysics: the classic readings(2000). Sprigge's own philosophy combined elements from Spinoza, Hegel, William James, and Francis Herbert Bradley. It 'emphasises the reality of the absolute, the larger unity that binds us together'. Professor Timothy L. S. Sprigge died aged 75 on 11 July 2007.

No place of origin recorded. 1818-1820 4to., 98 pages (approx. 14,000 words) pen and ink drawings, entirely Holograph neat sloping hand, in contemp. red straight grain morocco, marbled paper sides, light wear.  This Commonplace Book commenced at the very end of 1818 and continued only for a few months gives an interesting indication of the interests of a young woman in her early twenties. The subjects are mostly copied and mostly on topical subjects. They include articles on a variety of subjects including 'The Origin of English Counties', the 'Building of Waterloo Bridge', 'Scientific Subjects', Short Stories, the search for 'Longitude at Sea' etc. There are three articles on Musical Instruments illustrated with pen and ink drawings. viz. 'The Icelandic Instrument Lang-spiel', 'The Clarinet, and The French Horn. The final article on the Races of Persia ends abruptly in mid sentence, shortly after the birth of her son. Unusually, this commonplace book contains articles not normally associated with the readings of a young lady of this period and might well be at least partially influenced by the interests of her husband during the first year or so of their marriage prior to the arrival of their son Herbert.

Thomson defends examinations, discussing their impartiality, fairness, and showing their importance in a democratic society where individuals progress by merit rather than nepotism. Additionally, Thomson also acknowledges the problems of examinations – namely nerves; chance and luck; time pressures on both examinees and examiners; and the inconsistent relationship between examination performance, the school record, and teachers' own ratings. He discusses possible solutions to these problems, citing the marking of the eleven-plus examination in Darlington and Brighton respectively as solutions to the latter. Thomson also touches briefly on the processes involved in making a test.

Covenants such as this Confession of Faith and Covenant of the Church of Scotland in 1638, and again in 1643, which committed the individual and the nation to God, resulted in religious struggle. These public petitions presumed a Scottish relationship with God without a king or queen's interference. Although the text did not state it, copies of the documents signed throughout the country provided an excuse to condemn the episcopal system of Church administration.

The Scottish zoologist and chief scientist on the 'Challenger' expedition Charles Wyville Thomson was born at Bonsyde in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830. He was the son of a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company, and was baptized Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School and then he studied at Edinburgh University. In 1850 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at Kings College, Aberdeen, and then Professor of Botany at Marischal College, Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a Professor of Natural History in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at the Queen's University of Belfast, and in 1860 was transferred to the Chair of Natural History at the same institution.  In 1868 he assumed the duties of Professor of Botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh University. Wyville Thomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of dredgings in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS Lightning and HMS Porcupine for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. These researches showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in his work The Depths of the Sea. The results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of HMS Challenger for a global expedition. He was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872. The Challenger Expedition would be deemed a great success, and on his return Wyville Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he was also created a Knight of the Polar Star on a visit to Sweden. Thomson's published work includes The Depths of the Sea (1873) and The Voyage of the Challenger in the Atlantic (1880). Professor Sir Charles Wyville Thomson died at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882.

The letter from E. Gordon Duff is dated Tuesday 7 January 1913, on paper embossed with the arms of the Athenaeum, Liverpool. It is written to 'Dear Mr Johnston' . The letter refers to 'the two books in the Laing portraits'. Apparently the book 'on the table in the sitting portrait was a copy of some Scottish Acts'. The book had been 'sold in the final Laing sale'. When Duff had seen it a couple of months before writing the letter 'it was in the hands of a London firm of booksellers'. Duff goes on to say that the book in the second portrait 'is a MS of the Philobiblon' which 'is now in the University Library Cambridge. The letter was placed inside a copy of Notices of David Laing : to which is added a chronological list of the various publications which were issued under his editorial superintendence from the year M.DCCC.XV. to the year M.DCCC.LXVIII inclusive, by Thomas George Stevenson, 1878, along with a Letter from Harry Gidney Aldis (1863-1919) to Mr. Johnston, with rubbing fragment which is now at E2010.33.

The Main Library building of Edinburgh University Library was opened on George Square, Edinburgh in 1967. The new building was designed by J. Hardie Glover and Andrew Merrylees of the Sir Basil Spence partnership Spence, Glover & Ferguson (Edinburgh). Planning started in 1963 and construction began in March 1965. The building featured external materials such as Portland stone, concrete and glass, and interior finishes included teak, white beech, glazing, carpet tiling, and quartzite flooring. Furnishings in the building included Danish chairs in black plywood and stainless steel. When the new Library building was completed in September 1967, Edinburgh University Library began the move of some 2-million books from its old location, Playfair Library in the Old Quad' (designed by Robert Adam). Although the Main Library building has provided excellent space through its 40 year history, by the 2000s it was struggling to provide the facilities and working spaces required for 21st century methods of teaching, learning and research. In addition, four decades of wear and tear on the building meant that it was in need of a comprehensive upgrade. The University has invested 60 million in refurbishing the building to make it fir for new purpose. The article in the 1968 magazine piece featured in this collection was Jim Burgess, and the photographer was Henk Snoek (1915-1980). Snoek was said to be 'one of Britain's most accomplished architectural photographers', and worked for architects as diverse as Basil Spence and Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall. He was born in the Netherlands, and he studied at the Hague School of Art. Snoek's photography reflected the Bauhaus principles on which the Hague School of Art was run, and was 'characterised by a strong sense of drama, simple, forceful lines and high contrasts'.

Robert Persons, also known as Robert Parsons, was born on 24 June 1546 at Nether Stowey, Somerset. He studied at St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, in 1562, and on completion of these he became a fellow and tutor at Balliol College in 1568. However, because of his strong Catholic leanings, he was forced to resign in 1574. Persons left England in 1575 and entered the Jesuit Order in Rome returning with Edmund Campion (1540-1581) in 1580. He narrowly escaped again after Campion's arrest and martyrdom. In 1596, in Seville, he wrote Memorial for the Reformation of England, which provided insight into the kind of society England was to become after its return to the Catholic faith. Father Robert Persons died in Rome on 15 April 1610.

John Donaldson was born in 1789. He studied Law and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1826, though he was also a well-known teacher of music in Edinburgh. Though unsuccessful in his earlier candidacy in 1841, he was elected to the Reid Professorship of Music at Edinburgh University in 1845 on the death of Professor John Thomson. It was Donaldson who established a museum and purchased old and unusual musical instruments which today forms the John Donaldson Collection. As well as founding this collection which illustrates the history of music and acoustics, he built a fine hall as his music classroom with adjoining museum gallery, now known as the Reid Concert Hall. An organ built by Messrs. Hill and Sons (London) was constructed in the music classroom. It is said that Donaldson's lectures were not especially successful because he was not a practical musician, devoting himself rather more to the theory of harmony and investigating obscure questions of acoustics. Nevertheless, he held the Professorship until his death at Marchfield, his home near Edinburgh, on 12 August 1865.

Herbert Mather Spoor, a Yorkshireman, but latterly from Rochester, in Kent, was a Captain with the 77th Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery (a heavy artillery group). He attended Edinburgh University in the 1900s as a medical student and is believed to have been the founder of the University Cycling Club. While at the University he took a number of photographs showing life on campus, including some of members of the E.U. Cycling Club when they were out-and-about around the city. Spoor was awarded the degrees of M.B., Ch.B.Ed. from Edinburgh University in 1908 and became registered as a doctor on 18 December 1908. He practiced in Stoke, Rochester, at the practice of Trubridge, Coombe and Spoor. He was Superintendent at the local Hoo St. Werburgh Isolation Hospital. He was also a member of the British Medical Association and wrote for the Lancet in 1909. In 1918 Capt. Herbert Mather Spoor R.A.M.C. was posthumously awarded the Military Cross for 'conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty'. He was killed at the age of 45 on 13 December 1917, and is buried at Ypres Reservoir Cemetery, in Ieper (Ypres), Belgium.

At E2008.51 is a neat scribal copy of Scott's reflection on the instability of success, including his own fall from office. The full title of the work is: The Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmen, viz. Chancelars, Secretaries, Thesaurers and their deputs, Kings advocats, Justice Clerks, Clerks of Register, Privy Seall, Comptrollers, Admiralls and Cheif justices; for 100 years bygain, to witt from the year 1550, to the year 1650. Collected by Sr John Scott of Scottstarvet. Thomas Carlyle described it as 'a strange little book, not a satire but a Homily on Life's nothingness enforced by examples'. It circulated widely in manuscript in the seventeeth century, but was not published until 1754, edited by the antiquary Walter Goodal. The copy held at Special Collections, Edinburgh University Library, is from the library of Dr. Bent Juel-Jensen.

Johnston's poems are copies of typescript said to have been published in 2000 under the title New joined words, Livingston, West Lothian. There are 53-pages. The works of poetry are dated from 1957, with the poem 'The fish of horror' which was written at Honington, presumably R.A.F. Honington, and tell of a night of over-drinking. There is a poem written in 1966 - 'Good luck boys'. The remainder were written in succeeding decades up to 2001, with the poems 'To the north', 'Guid tae reign for aye!' and 'Symphony for Sydney Ross' being the latest. A few are undated. One of the poems from 2000 is a translation - 'Ken ye the Laun' - from 'Kennst du das Land' by J. W. Goethe. The poems have been numbered in pencil in the order presented by the donor (W.T.Johnston) in plastic sleeves inside a loose-leaf folder. They are now housed in an acid-free folder but maintaining the order as originally presented.

Angus McIntosh was born to Scottish parents near Sunderland, County Durham, on 10 January 1914. He was educated at Ryhope Grammar School, then at Oriel College Oxford where in 1934 he graduated with first class honours in English language and literature. Between 1936 and 1938 he was at Harvard and on his return to Britain he became a Lecturer at the Department of English, University College Swansea. During the Second World War, McIntosh initially served with the Tank Corps then as a Major in Military Intelligence during which time he was posted to Bletchley where he participated in the decrypting of German military communication Enigma codes. After the war he took up a lectureship at Christ Church Oxford and then in 1948 he was appointed first Forbes Professor of English Language and General Linguistics at Edinburgh University. At Edinburgh, he was the prime mover in the founding of the School of Epistemics - now Informatics - and the School of Scottish Studies, of the then separate Departments of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics. He was also behind two major dictionary projects and of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. While looking at returns from the questionnaire for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland, McIntosh realised the possibility of applying the methodology of modern dialect surveys to the investigation of past stages of the language. Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, known broadly to correlate with England's geographical regions. Experimenting with the Linguistic Survey data, he attempted to localise material from informants purely on the evidence of their written linguistic forms. The method which was devised - in what later became the Middle English Dialect Project - became known as the Fit Technique, and this was essentially an application of the principles of set theory to geographical distributions. It was to revolutionise dialect research in historical linguistics.A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English, or LALME, was published in 1986, 34 years after its inception, and enthusiastically received in the scholarly community. LALME led the advent of variationist methodology in the study of the linguistic history. McIntosh did pioneering work for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and this resulted in the publication in 1952 of hisIntroduction to a Survey of Scottish Dialects. In the same year he set up the Joint Council for the Scottish Dictionaries. He was also a tireless supporter of both theScottish National Dictionaryand theDictionary of the Older Scottish Tongueor DOST. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Scottish Text Society - and later honorary president - and for many years he was a member of the Early English Text Society's council. He was a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and he was a fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Professor Angus McIntosh died on 26 October 2005, aged 91. That same year, the Departments of English Language and of Linguistics at Edinburgh University, both founded by McIntosh, merged.

James Campbell was born at Carsphairn (Dumfries and Galloway), on 16 July 1789, to William Campbell (1755-1829) and his wife Agnes (nee Riggs) (1760-1838). He studied for the ministry at Glasgow University (matriculated 1806) and was licensed by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright on 7 May 1817. He spent time as tutor to the Hart family of Castlemilk, and travelled to France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with them (around 1814). He was with them during their flight from France when Napoleon returned to power. On his return to Scotland he searched for a suitable parish, and became tutor to the family of Robert Nutter Campbell of Kailzie in Traquair parish. He was ordained as Minister of Traquair (Church of St. Bride) in September 1820, having been presented by George, Prince Regent, in January 1820. Campbell spent his whole ministerial career in Traquair. On 26 October 1820 James Campbell married Mary Combe (d. 1860), daughter of Matthew Combe, a Leith brewer. One of their daughters, Agnes Mary Campbell, married Jardine Wallace (1834-1910) who succeeded James Campbell as Minister at Traquair. James Campbell died on 29 April 1861, aged 71.

Edward Gibbon Wakefield was born in London on 20 March 1796, eldest son of Edward Wakefield (1774-1854), philanthropist and statistician, and grandson of merchant Edward Wakefield (1750-1826) and author and philanthropist Priscilla Wakefield (1751-1832). He was the brother of William Hayward Wakefield (1803-1848), and nephew of Daniel Wakefield (1776-1846). Edward Gibbon Wakefield was educated at Westminster School and at Edinburgh's Royal High School. By 1814, he was serving with the British embassy in Turin, and in 1820 with the embassy in Paris. In 1826 however, he was convicted - with his brother William - of tricking a wealthy heiress into marrying him, and both he and his brother were sent to prison for three years. While he was in prison Wakefield studied colonial affairs and prepared material for publication into a work entitledFacts relating to the punishment of death in the metropolis(1831). He put forward a theory of systematic colonisation and enunciated his views inA letter from Sydney(1820), inEngland and America(1833), and inA view of the art of colonisation(1849). He saw a relationship between the social conditions in Britain and the notion of colonial settlement, viewing the latter as a chance for Britons to take their skills overseas under a familiar constitutional tradition and in a recognisable social framework. Land would be sold in small lots at moderate prices, with the funds gathered then being used to support further colonisation, and some self-government would be allowed. In 1834, the South Australian Association was formed with a view to founding a colony on Wakefield's principles. In 1838, Wakefield accompanied Lord Durham, John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham to Canada and influenced the new Governor-General'sReport on the affairs of British North Americawhich proposed uniting the Canadian provinces and granting them full control of their internal affairs. In 1839, he formed the New Zealand Land Company - an amalgamation of an earlier New Zealand Association and a New Zealand Colonization Company - with the aim of settling and guiding the colony of New Zealand. His brother William would control operations in New Zealand, while Wakefield himself would direct the Company from London where he could continue to argue his case with the Colonial Office. In 1849 he founded - with John Robert Godley (1814-1861) - a Church of England settlement at Canterbury in New Zealand. In 1852, Wakefield left England for New Zealand with his son, landing in Port Lyttleton in February 1853. At once, both father and son launched themselves into New Zealand politics, with the elder Wakefield advising the acting-Governor Colonel Robert Henry Wynyard (1802-1864). In 1854 however, he suffered a complete breakdown in his health. Edward Gibbon Wakefield died in Wellington, New Zealand, on 16 May 1862. His only son, Edward Jerningham Wakefield (1820-1879), who had written on New Zealand based on his earlier stay there, as well as politican, had been elected to the House of Representatives in 1854, representing a Canterbury constituency. He had accompanied his father to Canada in 1838, and first went to New Zealand in 1839, returning to England in 1845. With John Robert Godley, he edited his father's correspondence on the foundation of the Canterbury settlement with the titleThe founders of Canterbury(1868).

At E2010.24 there is an autograph letter signed from Marwick to Professor Bruce Dickins, placed and dated as Alton (Kirkwall), 26 January 1965. The letter was written around 3-4 months before his death and is autobiographical. The content is largely reminiscenses about his time at Edinburgh University. He writes, 'There are now so few of my old-time friends surviving that I feel very lonely [and] to hear from any of them is a rare pleasure. Do you know – of my friends of my Univ. days I don't know of any one left!' He goes on to tell about his lodgings in Edinburgh and how he shared with three Orcadians: R.C. Wallace (later Principal of Queen's University, Ontario); J.A. Gunn (later Director of the Nuffield Institute of Medical Research, Oxford); and, Gunn's younger brother J.W.C. Gunn (later Professor of Pharmacology at Cape Town). Apparently the lodgings 'all found were 16 shillings a week'. The small collection also includes some note and letter fragments, and offprints of three articles by Marwick: 'The 'Old Man' in Place-Names', Saga och Sed, (1959); 'An Old Celtic Loan-word in Orkney Place-Names', Namn och Bygd, Vol. 48 (1960); and, review of F.T. Wainwright's 'The Northern Isles', Scottish Studies, Vol. 7, pt 1 (1963).

Beale gained MRC funding in 1966 to embark on a programme conducting genetic analyses of malaria parasites. Walliker was suggested to Beale as a collaborator by Professor P.C.C. Garnham at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who had supervised Garnham's PhD on fish parasites. By early 1970, the first genetic cross had been successfully conducted in a rodent malaria parasite, which demonstrated the Mendelian nature of genetic inheritance of malaria parasites. Walliker took over the direction of this project after Beale's retirement and became the leading figure in the Edinburgh malaria genetics programme. In 1986, Walliker was made an honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh.

duet: son nator from Giulio Cesare by Georg Frideric Handel
|
The ornamental turner Charles Holtzapffel was born in 1806. He was the son of the German engineer John Jacob Holtzapffel (1768-1835), from Alsace, who had settled in London in the 1780s and who had founded the tool business in the 1790s. Trading as John Holtzapffel in London's Long Acre, the firm was noted for its production of iron-bedded lathes with ornamental turning apparatus. In 1804 the firm was expanded to include John George Deyerlein but this arrangement lasted only until 1827. In 1827, Charles Holtzapffel joined the firm at the age of 21. The younger Holtzapffel had received a good English education, and through careful training in the firm's workshop he had become a skilled engineer in his own right. On the death of his father, Charles carried on the firm and continued to develop the machinery and attachments for ornamental turnery. Other devices were invented too, including machinery for printing banknotes, a dividing engine for the graduation of drawing scales, and an apparatus for tracing geometrical figures on glass. In 1838, Charles published hisNew system of scales of equal parts applicable to various purposes of engineering, architecture and general sciencefollowed by its complement, theList of scales of equal parts. In 1843, he publishedTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 1: Materials, their choice, preparation and various modes of working them. This was actually his father's work and was followed in 1846 by his ownTurning and mechanical manipulation. Volume 2: Construction, action, and application of cutting tools. By 1884, five volumes of this turner's bible had been published by Charles and his son John Jacob Holtzapffel II. Charles Holtzapffel was a member of the Council of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was Chairman of the Mechanic's Committee of the Society of Arts. He died on 11 April 1847 and his widow Amelia Vaux (Dutton) Holtzapffel managed the firm until 1853. Their son John Jacob became head of the firm in 1867 and managed the business until 1896 when Charles' nephew George William Budd (later known as George William Holtzapffel) took over. John Jacob Holtzapffel II died in Eastbourne on 14 October 1897. In 1919, Colonel John George Holtzapffel Budd, the son of George William Holtzapffel, began to take an active part in running the firm.

One of Beatty's students, Richard Hancock, found in 1974 that when anti-cock sperm antisera were added to rabbit semen used for insemination, the proportion of male offspring was significantly reduced. This work was in response to the findings of I.A Burkov (1968), who suggested that antibodies to cock sperm would react selectively with Y-bearing rabbit sperm. Hancock and Beatty continued to collaborate in and correspond about this work after Hancock moved to the University of Bristol. Hancock published 'Comparisons of effects of normal rabbit sera and anti-cock sperm sera on rabbit sperm, including comparison of effects on the sex ratio' in Biology of Reproduction, 18:510-515 (1978).

In his letter, dated 3 Mar 1938 and numbered 13 (38), Thomson thanks Ledermann for his previous letter, and responds to his points regarding the reciprocity of persons and tests, referring to Burt's statement that we can always deduce all we want to know about person-factors from an analysis into test-factors, or vice versa, and need only perform whichever analysis is convenient. Thomson disagrees with this, apart from in the case of doubly centred matrices, and illustrates his point with examples throughout. Also includes a postcard, dated 5 Mar 1938 and numbered 13a (38), in which Thomson asks Ledermann to work out a formula using M S Bartlett's principle of minimising the other factors not used.

The study is concerned with 'one of the earliest known historical accounts of Acadian Deportation' which was written by the Rev. Dr. Andrew Brown in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Brown's manuscript was entitled Removal of the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia by Lieut. Governor Lawrence and His Majesty's Council in October 1755. The primary purpose of the study was to provide an annotated edition of the manuscript, but it also takes a broader look at Brown. The external thesis was written by Sara J. Beanlands of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was submitted to Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in September 2010.

The former have been organised by Hector and Lady Thomson, who have added notes and annotations in many cases either to assist with Sir James Duff's editing of Thomson's autobiography, or to assist Lady Thomson with her own projected biography of Thomson. The later was never completed, most likely due to Lady Thomson's ill health in her later years.

William Saunders was born in Kirkcaldy in 1877. He matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1906 and followed courses in Economic History, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and English Literature. He does not appear to have graduated.Saunders published a text-book Ancient Handwriting: An Introductory Manual for Intending Students of Palaeography and Diplomatic in 1909. He was subsequently Honorary Secretary of Leith Nautical College and Editor of the Scottish Musical Magazine. He published articles and gave lectures and radio talks on a wide range of  musical, literary, and historical subjects. He was also a keen book-collector who built a substantial personal library on the history and topography of Fife.Saunders died 1948. James Clarkson Corson appears to have been appointed his literary executor, but we have not, as yet, established the nature of the relationship between Saunders and Corson.

Thomson outlines his ideals for educational research, which he feels is at its best when conducted by an individual investigating fundamental educational problems. He acknowledges that modern research is in reality constrained by input from collaborators or funders. Thomson discusses how research bodies such as the National Foundation and the Scottish Council for Research in Education can help the researcher in a variety of ways, including not limiting the researcher with too many or too exacting instructions, not demanding too quick a return, and involving the researcher in the design of experiments. He explores team work and co-operation, giving the Scottish Mental Surveys as an example, and emphasises the importance of strong, inspirational, and collaborative leadership. He also discusses the responsibilities of the researcher undertaking individual research, including the design of experiments and the utilising of research tools such as statistics; and the supposed dichotomy of fundamental and operational research. The lecture is written on the reverse side of headed paper from the Twelfth International Congress of Psychology. Edinburgh, 23rd July-29th July.

The Scottish poet Sorley MacLean was born in Oscaig, Raasay, on 26 October 1911. He was educated locally and then at Portree High School. He studied English Literature at Edinburgh University from 1929, graduating in 1933 with a First. MacLean then began a teaching career, starting in Portree after qualifying from Moray House (teacher training college). Briefly between 1937-1938 he taught at Tobermoray Secondary School before returning to Edinburgh in 1939 to the English Department of Boroughmuir High School. In 1940, MacLean joined the Signals Corps and was posted to North Africa. He was seriously wounded at El Alamein in November 1942, and was invalided home to Scotland. He returned to his teaching post at Boroughmuir in 1943. In 1946 he married Renee Cameron. Although their life seemed settled in Edinburgh, and Sorley had been drawn into the literary circle of Douglas Young and his associates, which included George Campbell Hay, Norman McCaig, and especially Robert Garioch (Alastair Sutherland), he accepted the appointment of Headmaster at Plockton High School in 1956. MacLean's output included Seventeen Poems for Six-pence (with Garioch, 1940), Dain do Eimhir (1943), and co-authorship of Four Points of a Saltire (1970). He retired as Headmaster at Plockton in 1972 but then found himself drawn into a new educational experience, first as the Creative Writing Fellow at Edinburgh University (1973-5) and then as Filidh ('Poet') at the then embryonic Gaelic College at Sabhal Mor Ostaig (1975-6). Sorley MacLean died in Inverness on 24 November 1996.

Beale's interest in Russia stemmed from the Second World War, when he was in the Intelligence Corps (Field Security) Army Base Unit convoy posted in Archangel in 1941. Beale had some Russian already and was fluent by the time he returned. He kept up a correspondence with various Russian scientists throughout his lifetime, and retained an interest in the fate of science during the Soviet Union, particularly the career of Soviet biologist and agronomist Trofim Lysenko.

This autograph letter signed is dated 22 November 1937, and it was written from 'Seamark', Lloyd Road, Hove, Sussex, and addressed to 'My dear Ballie'. The letter regrets that he 'did not see' Baillie last August but that he he will 'have better luck next year'. He has the hope though that he 'will pay me a visit here some day'. The letter accompanied 'this book' - presumably Nicodemus. A mystery (1937). He suggests that if 'you like it at all you may have a chance of suggesting the play for performance'. He believes that in England 'at least' the religious drama 'has a future'. If Baillie is ever to happen to write to him he asks if 'in one word' he might be told 'what people like yourself think of Dunne's Experiment with Time as a proof of Immortality'.

Henrik Kacser began studying for a diploma in animal genetics within the Institute of Animal Genetics in 1951, after gaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast. He made such a good impression that C.H. Waddington, at Beale's recommendation, asked Kacser if he would like to stay on as lecturer. He remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, working chiefly on physical and chemical approaches to biology, including metabolic control analysis.  This material was most likely gathered together as part of the research for Beale's obituary of Kacser, which he wrote with Grahame Bulfield for the Royal Society.

Within the collection there is an autograph letter signed from the X-ray pioneer to 'My dear Forbes' on their leaving the Royal High School, placed and dated as Edinburgh (Dalhousie Terrace), 13 March 1889. The letter was written when Spence was 17-years old. He writes, 'In parting with you I part from a friend, and I hope you will not take it as an insult when I say that I have a greater liking for you than I ever had for any of my companions'. He hopes Forbes reached home safely, and he is looking forward to seeing his own parents soon: 'They will leave Constantinople about the first week of April'. He has been up at the school 'paying the V a general visit'. Spence goes on to talk about the forthcoming 'Interscholastic Games at Corstorphine' to be held on 13 April 1889, and how 'Wilson is going in for the long drop at the Interscholastic' and how he 'was thinking of going in for the half mile handicap' at their own School Games to be held on the same day. Additionally, some local historical information is provided in that there is a reference to Jessie King who 'was executed in the Calton Jail on Monday morning. She took things very coolly to the very last', he writes. Although Spence studied Medicine at University, his letter tells of 'doing a little Xenophon every day with the view to going up in October for Greek and Dynamics'.

Thomson informs Ledermann that his article can be printed in Sociometrika or Psychometrika. He is unsure if the former exists and thinks it may be a typing error. Thomson mentions that he has many letters and manuscripts of Ledermann still to acknowledge. These cover topics such as boundary conditions, and Ridley Thomson's criterion. Thomson lists the letters and manuscripts with brief comments. He also discusses the progress of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, briefly outlining a possible structure and referring to work he has consulted including that of E B Wilson, Maxwell Garnett, and Irwin. Thomson finishes the letter by telling Ledermann to have a good holiday.

Thomson discusses the importance of discipline in class both in a general sense, and specifically relating to music classes. He discusses the pitfalls of both too lenient and too harsh discipline; the importance of forming rules and ensuring these are as clear and as few as possible; the participation of pupils in rule making and reporting when rules are broken; and assigning a fitting punishment. He also gives pointers for achieving discipline, and stresses the responsibilities the teacher must undertake, including keeping proper records of students' progress and attendance, paying attention to the class, learning their names and being observant; and ensuring students' work is properly marked and good work rewarded.

First-class cricketer Harry Lindsay Somerled MacDonald was born in Westminster, London, on 2 August 1861. He was the grandson of Donald Macdonald, of Sandside, Caithness, and was the only son of Lt-Col. William Donald MacDonald of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (1827-1862) and Miss Emma Anne Elizabeth Lindsay (married in 1860).  The younger MacDonald was himself commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Fife division of the Royal Artillery in 1879. In 1883, he was promoted from Lieutenant to Captain in the fourth brigade of the Scottish Division of the Royal Artillery. He resigned his commission in 1887 and resigned from the reserve of officers in 1892.  Earlier, on 12 July 1887, he married Lillian Margaret Coke (daughter of R.G.Coke Esq) of Brimington Hall, Derbyshire, and the pair settled in Bathford, near Bath. MacDonald played club cricket in the Bath area of Somerset in the 1890s. Harry Lindsay Somerled MacDonald died at Bathford, Somerset, on 15 August 1936.

In 1943, MMM appeared to be living in Seamill, West Kilbride (North Ayrshire). She wrote a typescript letter to 'Katherine' in September 1943. Typed on the rear of the letter was: Keep this address beside you: Miss Sheila Hodges, Director, Victor Gollancz Ltd. Sheila Hodges apparently joined the publishing firm of Victor Gollancz in 1936, becoming Assistant Managing Director in 1943 to take charge of the editorial department. Taking over from Daphne du Maurier's previous editor who had been called up during the war, she edited the works of Daphne du Maurier over a period spanning nearly forty years from 1943-1981.

Includes a handwritten draft as well as the final lecture. Thomson argues that music plays a part in every aspect of education, physical, aesthetic, and moral, and makes a case for music to be given a prominent place in the school curriculum. He opines that musical ability is correlated with mathematical and logical ability, and links early acquisition of complex rhythms to later mathematical ability.

Thomson parallels and compares competition in the natural world, where the weakest are eliminated and education through play prepares the individual for their environment, with that in the human world, where co-operation protects the unfit and education contributes to a differential birth rate.  He discusses possible reasons for the connection between intelligence, education, and family size, exploring whether this phenomenon is due to genetics, environment, or both. He refers to intelligence testing he has conducted throughout several counties in England, including that of an English mining community and a concurrent test on Fatherless children; and testing carried out by the Mental Defective Committee establishing an increase in the incidence of mental defect.  Thomson outlines the ethical implications of such findings, and how imperative it is that all individuals be offered the best free education they can use. He argues that education is a crucial part of the solution to the differential birth rate.

He describes the reaction to an Englishman taking the post at Moray House, his daily surroundings, and the connections between Moray House and the faculty of Education at the University of Edinburgh. He also describes the history of Moray House College, particularly the split of the Established Church College and the Free Church College.

William Fraser was born in the Mearns, Kincardineshire, on 18 February 1816. After private education in Stonehaven, in 1830 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the firm of Messrs., Brand and Burnett, solicitors in the town. In 1835 he went to Edinburgh where he joined the firm of Hill and Tod, WS, and continued his education at Edinburgh University , studying Scots' Law and conveyancing. He also took classes in French.  Many of the legal cases in which he became involved had required antiquarian and, in particular, genealogical research, and he was therefore introduced at an early stage to those studies in which he later on would became an expert. He steadily built up a great body of knowledge which made possible his great series of fifty or so volumes on the histories of between twenty and thirty of the leading noble and landed families of Scotland - the Stirlings of Keir, 1858; the Montgomeries, 1859; the Maxwells of Pollok, 1863; the Carnegies, 1867; Grandtully, 1868; Colquhoun, 1869; Carlaverock, 1873; Lennox, 1874; Cromartie, 1876; Scotts of Buccleuch, 1878; Menteith, 1880; Grant, 1883; Douglas, 1885; Wemyss, 1888; Haddington, 1889; Melvilles, 1890; Sutherland, 1892; and Annandale, 1894. Fraser was Keeper of her Majesty Queen Victoria's Records in Scotland, from 1852-1894. In 1882 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1885 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath and in 1887 he was made a Civil Knight Commander of the Bath, being invested by Queen Victoria at Osborne House on 2 August 1887. Sir William Fraser, KCB, LL.D., solicitor, notable expert in ancient Scottish history, palaeography, and genealogy, died on 13 March 1898. The Sir William Fraser Chair of Scottish History and Palaeography at the University of Edinburgh, was founded in 1901. The work Facsimiles of Scottish Charters and Letters prepared by Sir William Fraser, K.C.B., LL.D. for his series of Scottish family histories was published and printed by Oliver and Boyd, 1903.

He thanks Thomson for sending him a copy of the book, and concludes that it was worthwhile work, though the tests were not designed for factor analysis and are not suitable for measuring what he describes as practical intelligence.

Robert McCheyne was born in Edinburgh on 21 May 1813. He was educated at the city's Royal High School and then he studied at Edinburgh University, matriculating in 1827. In 1831, he began studies at Divinity Hall and was licensed to preach in 1835. In November 1835 he was appointed as Assistant to the Rev. John Bonar of Larbert and Dunipace, Stirling. He became a well-known preacher and was ordained to St. Peter's Church, Dundee, in November 1836. In 1839 he was part of a committee sent to Palestine by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland to collect information about Jews. McCheyne and Andrew Bonar (d. 1892) recorded their journey in Narrative of a mission of inquiry to the Jews (1842). The Rev. Robert McCheyne died on 25 March 1843, and he was buried by St. Peter's Church, Dundee.

The mineralogist Robert Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774. His early education was received in Leith and then he became the apprentice of a surgeon in Leith, with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at Edinburgh University, studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. By 1793, and influenced by the Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731-1803), he abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's museum. In 1793, he went to London, meeting naturalists and visiting museums to take notes. A visit to the Shetland Islands followed in 1794, to explore the geology, mineralogy, zoology and botany there. This led to the publication of The mineralogy of the Shetland Islands and of Arran, with an appendix containing observations on peat, kelp, and coal (1798). Earlier, in 1796, Jameson read two papers rejecting the vulcanist interpretation of the formation of Earth that had been put forward by Edinburgh geologist James Hutton (1726-1797). Hutton had propounded the theory that the features of the Earth's crust were caused by natural processes over geologic time; the principle of uniformitarianism. Instead, Jameson supported the ideas of Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750-1817) who had proclaimed the aqueous origin of rocks; that rocks were formed when immense quantities of minerals precipitated out of the waters of the biblical flood.Other visits to the Scottish islands in the north and west, and to Ireland, produced the two volume Mineralogy of the Scottish isles (1800) which was a fuller description of his views. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiburg, Saxony, to study under Werner. He returned to Edinburgh in 1802.  On the death of Walker in 1803, Jameson was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Keeper of the University Museum. Over his fifty year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum, including fossils, birds and insects. Although he had been one of the great exponents of Werner's geological tenets and founded the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808, Jameson afterwards admitted conversion to the views of Hutton. He died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1854. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum (now Royal Museum) in Edinburgh's Chambers Street.

The lecture was addressed to students upon their graduation, and Thomson's sense of humour is in evidence throughout. He advises the students not to rest on their oars, but to keep learning throughout their life and to widen their knowledge; to know the character of their pupils and be an example to them; and to work hard and subsequently benefit from the satisfaction attained from hard work.

The Canadian Pacific Railway Company entered the ship-owning business in 1884 with three steamers which were built to operate Great Lakes services. In 1887 a service between Vancouver and the Orient was begun with chartered vessels, to be followed in 1891 by the company's own 'Empress' ships - the 'Empress of China', the 'Empress of India' and the 'Empress of Japan'. Then, in 1890, passenger routes were established between Toronto, Montreal and Chicago. Transatlantic passenger services commenced in 1903 when the fleet was augmented by the acquisition of the North Atlantic interests of Elder Dempster & Company. The Company's 'Empress of Britain' (the first of that name) and 'Empress of Ireland' came into service in 1906. The 'Empress of Asia' and the 'Empress of Russia' followed in 1913, the 'Empress of France' in 1919, and the 'Empress of Scotland' in 1921. In 1921 too the title of the operating company became Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd. On the outbreak of war in 1939, Canadian Pacific placed all their ships at the disposal of the government and several were taken over as troopships. For the company, Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, the passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times. The more modern 'Empress of Britain' was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. The first had been renamed the 'Montroyal' in 1924 and was scrapped in 1930, and the second which came into service in 1931 had been requisitioned as a troopship in 1939. This one was bombed, torpedoed and sunk in the North Atlantic in 1940. The newer ship was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and was the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain'. The 25,526 ton ship was launched by the Queen in 1955 and was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963. It was then chartered for cruising and was sold in November 1964 to a Greek company. Renamed the 'Queen Anna Maria' it sailed from Piraeus to New York and later on from Haifa to New York. In 1975 the ship was sold to Carnival Cruise Lines and was renamed 'Carnivale'. Its name changed again in 1993 to the 'Fiesta Marina'. In April 2000 the ship was still in service, this time with the Greek firm Epirotiki Cruises and called the 'Olympic'.

Thomson advises Ledermann to keep the letters he sends him for future reference. He discusses a paper he has written for the British Journal of Psychology, which regards the influence selection has over factorial analysis, and asks Ledermann if he should shorten it.  He advises Ledermann to make use of some of the concepts for a paper of his own regarding matrix notation, and refers him to work of Hotelling, Thurstone, and Aitken, particularly Aitken's paper, Note on Selection from a Multivariate Normal Population, from Proceedings of Edinburgh Mathematical Society, 1935. Thomson also discusses the possibility of locating a copy of Darmois' Statistique Mathematique, and informs Ledermann of his plans for the next few weeks, which include returning to Edinburgh then possibly staying at Glenapp in Ayrshire.

Eric Olof Lundholm was born in 1915 in Modderfontein, in the Transvaal, South Africa. His parents were Goesta Lundholm, a chemist, and Dr. Agnes Barr Auchencloss. His great-grandfather, Olof Lundholm, was personal attendant to Carl XIV Johan, King of Sweden. As Master of the Household he served the Swedish Court for 68 years and throughout the reigns of four Swedish monarchs, and was awarded the Vasa Order in 1864. Lundholm's grandfather, Carl Olof Lundholm, a noted engineer, was an associate of Alfred Nobel who asked him to manage his new fulminate of mercury plant at Westquarter, near Falkirk, in Scotland, and was then appointed Manager of Nobel's Explosive Company at Ardeer, near Stevenston. Goesta Lundholm, earlier a chemist with the British South African Explosive Co. Ltd. became Superintendent at the ICI Detonator Factory at Westquarter. The young Eric Olof Lundholm received his early education in Modderfontein, and then with the family's move to Scotland, his secondary education was provided at Falkirk High School. Glasgow University followed, and in 1937 he graduated B.Sc. First Class Honours in Geology, and became Baxter Demonstrator in Geology. In 1939 he enrolled at Glasgow Medical School but after the outbreak of war he was called up in August 1940 into a chemical warfare training battalion, Royal Engineers. He was commissioned in June 1941 and posted to a Boring Unit R.E., and saw service in the Middle East, first unblocking oil wells at Kirkuk, cemented by the Allies against possible German advance, thereafter on water supply development by bore-holes. On demobilisation in February 1946, Lundholm resumed his medical course, graduating M.B. Ch.B. at Glasgow University in July 1950. One year as House Surgeon and House Physician was followed by specialising in Psychiatry, and he took the Diploma in Psychological Medicine (DPM) of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ireland in 1953. In April 1960, Eric Olof Lundholm married Dorothy Vida Henning, B.A. M.Sc. (Geography, Trinity College, Dublin) who was an Assistant Lecturer in Geography at Glasgow University and subsequently became a Medical Artist, working in the Anatomy Department, illustrating professorial writings. Dr. Eric Olof Lundholm retired in July 1980 after working in psychiatric hospitals in West and East Scotland with special interests in therapeutic communities, individual and group psychotherapy and psychogeriatric medicine. He lives in Edinburgh.

Signed call by the congregation of St Columba's Parish Church, Kilmacolm, inviting Donald Macpherson Baillie to be their minister.
|
John Baillie was born in 1886, the son of Rev John Baillie ( 1829-1891), Free Church minister at Gairloch, Ross & Cromarty in the north-west of Scotland, and his wife Annie Macpherson. John (senior) was a graduate of both the University of Edinburgh and Free Church College, Edinburgh Following the death of his father in 1891, the family home was at Inverness and John (junior) was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force. The end of that war saw his marriage to Florence Jewel Fowler and the start of his academic career. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retrial six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches; he became a President of the latter. John Baillie's brother, Donald Macpherson Baillie ( 1887-1954) was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and at the Universities of Edinburgh, Marburg and Heidelberg. He graduated with an MA from New College Edinburgh in 1909, and he spent some time with the YMCA in France before being ordained in 1918 and was minister of Bervie United Free Church until 1923. Moving to St. John's, Cupar he was there until 1930 and then at St. Columba's, Kilmacolm until 1934. Donald was appointed Kerr lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1923, delivering lectures in 1926. In 1935 he became Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of St Andrews, where he had been Additional examiner for the BD degree in Divinity and Ecclesiastical History from 1921-1924, and which had awarded him an Honorary DD in 1933.

Godfrey Hilton Thomson was born in Carlisle on 27 March 1881. His Mother, Jane Thomson nee Hilton, separated from his Father, Charles Thomson, when he was an infant, taking him with her to Felling, Tyneside, where Thomson attended High Felling Board School. Thomson showed academic promise from an early age, winning a scholarship for Rutherford College; passing the London Matriculation exam, which enabled him to return to High Felling Board School as a pupil teacher; and coming third in the UK wide Queen's Scholarship, which allowed him to continue his studies in Armstrong College, Durham University.  Thomson studied for his teaching diploma and a joint Mathematics and Physics degree simultaneously, graduating with Distinction. He went on to study at Strasbourg under the Nobel prize winning physicist, Professor Ferdinand Braun, graduating Summa cum Laude following his work on Herzian waves.  After gaining his PhD, Thomson returned to Newcastle, attaining the post of assistant lecturer at Armstrong College in order to fulfil the obligations of his scholarship. It was here he met his wife, Jennie Hutchinson, a fellow lecturer, whom he married in 1912. Their son, Hector, was born in 1917.  In 1916, Thomson published a paper which would ignite a 30 year debate with psychologist, Charles Spearman. The debate centred on Spearman's Theory of Two Factors, which attributed intelligence to a single, general factor, g and a large number of specific mental skills. Thomson provided an alternative for this in his bonds model, in which tests of intelligence sampled pools of bonds, with those tests that sampled the more closely-related pools having the higher correlations (Thomson made a link between these bonds and the neurons of the brain). Thomson had no wish to discredit Spearman's theory, rather to provide an alternative, and he held off publication during the war years to enable Spearman, who was serving, time to respond.  In 1921, the local authorities of Newcastle, who provided bursaries for secondary school education, were concerned by a lack of applicants from rural backgrounds. Thomson was asked to design a test which would make selection a more fair process. Conscious of the fact that rural children were often absent from school, he aimed to create a test which allowed children to demonstrate their native wit or innate intelligence, rather than past learning.  In 1925, despite pressure from Edward Lee Thorndike to accept a post at Columbia University following a highly successful year there as visiting Professor (1923-1924), Thomson accepted both the Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and the post of Director of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre, Moray House (later Moray House College of Education). The two positions had never been held by the same candidate, and never were again.  It was here in what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit that Thomson and his team formulated the Moray House Tests, based on Thomson's earlier Northumberland tests. The tests were used throughout the UK for School selection, particularly in England, and by 1948 had been given to two out of three British children. Thomson believed testing was preferable to nepotism, and worked on making the tests as fair as possible. Profit was put in a research fund to facilitate their continued improvement. In 1931, the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) set up the Mental Survey Committee. This was in response to the International Conference on Examinations, which had been attended by representatives from Scotland, Switzerland, England, France, Germany, and the United States of America. The purpose of the conference, which was supported by Carnegie Foundation and the International Institute of Teachers College, Columbia University, was to explore international concerns regarding the validation of examinations for school assessment and selection. It was decided that each country should undertake a research exercise. The Scottish Mental Survey, a test of the entire nation's intelligence, was Scotland's unique contribution. Thomson was at the centre of this project – not only was his Moray House Test No. 12 selected for the survey, he was also assistant Chair of the committee. On June 1, 1932, almost every Scottish child born in 1921 was tested. 87,498 Scottish children in total sat down to the test. By 1947, Thomson was Chairman of the Mental Survey Committee, and the exercise was repeated for school children born in 1936, with the addition of questionnaires which gleaned data regarding the child's social, familial, and economic background. The purpose of this second survey was to measure whether Scotland's intelligence had decreased in response to the perceived differential birth rate. The results were surprising, showing a slight increase in intelligence. Intelligence and its measurement would fascinate Thomson throughout his career, and his talents in that area would see his work lauded by renowned figures such as Carlos Paton Blacker, Cyril Burt, Karl Pearson, and Sir Edmund Whittaker. He published prolifically on intelligence, statistics, and education through journal articles and books. His book, the Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, ran to 5 editions (1939-1951), and was seen as a definitive authority on factor analysis. Its publication was facilitated by the Carnegie Corporation, which awarded Thomson a £5000 grant on the endorsement of E L Thorndike, and Thomas S Arbuthnot. Thomson was also the co-founding editor, alongside Cyril Burt, of the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology. Alongside this, Thomson held great passion for teaching and the imparting of knowledge. His beliefs regarding the importance of engaging students and pupils in lectures and classes, now common place, were highly innovative in his time. He strove to ensure that each individual would be put on the path suited to both their abilities and interests, which he believed would ultimately produce satisfied individuals, and subsequently good citizens. Thomson had several honours bestowed upon him during his lifetime, including fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1926; Third Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta conferred by the President of the Polish republic in recognition of his services to Polish interests during the war, 1944; Presidency of the British Psychological Society, 1945-1946; honorary membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1947; and a Knighthood for services to Education, 1949.  On his retirement from the University of Edinburgh in 1951, Thomson, who had proved highly popular amongst staff and students, was presented with 2 portraits of himself by R H Westwater, one of which hangs in Moray House to this day. He continued to publish up until his illness and subsequent death on 9 February 1955 in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. His wife, by then Lady Thomson, received numerous letters from Thomson's acquaintances, contemporaries, former pupils, and friends, many of which survive in his collection, attesting to his scientific achievements as well as his humanity.

The journal is in the form of a folio notebook, 69pp with additional blank pages. Original marbled wrappers. It is a diary covering two journeys abroad. The first journey began in December 1889 and took Harry Lindsay Somerled MacDonald and Lilian Margaret Coke on a trip from London to Paris, Marseilles, Corsica, Algiers, Cannes, Nice, Genoa, Rome, Naples, Palermo, again Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, over the Allps, Zurich, heidelberg, Brussels, and back to London on 2 July 1890. The second journey began in the Spring 1891 and covered Geneva, Zurich, Salzburg, Linz, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade to Constantinople on the orient Express, Athens, Sevastopol, Balaclava, Inkerman, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and returning via Stockholm, Gothenburg and Christiana (Oslo). The first journey cost just over Pounds Sterling 83, and the second cost Pounds Sterling 92 including travelling expenses in Norway and the boat to Scotland. There is also a carte de visite photograph of Lt-Col. William Donald MacDonald of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (1827-1862) dressed in his hunting clothing and holding a rifle.

The content of the 1st and 2nd year engineering note-books (laboratory books) of Dr. Russell A. Leather reflect the wide approach in studies which covered mechanical devices, steel structures and electrical technology. The books include graphwork, drawings, and photographs of late-1940s laboratory equipment at Kings Buildings (1948-1949). Photographs feature the 'Riehle' testing machine', the 'Adie' cement testing machine, a torsion testing machine, the 'Ambler' compression machine, the 'Olsen' testing machine, the 'Vickers' hardness testing machine, a tensometer machine, a petrol engine and dynamometer, a gas engine, a 'Leyland' high speed oil engine, the 'Heenan and Froude' hydraulic dynamometer, an air compressor, and a 'Paxman' steam engine. Apparently, experiments involving the 'Paxman' steam engine would be an all-day affair, beginning with start-up of the engine in the morning. The coal fed to the engine would be carefully weighed, and the calorific value of the coal had to be known. Horsepower would have to worked out; measurements taken of energy in and energy out. The note-books consist of:

The lecture explains factorial analysis in non-mathematical terms as far as possible, and Thomson explores how psychologists and mathematicians can work together and co-operate in order to gain knowledge of intelligence differences. Thomson references the work of Spearman, Hotelling, and Thurstone. Also includes a follow on lecture with 2 slides titled Positive Structure in Factorial Analysis, and three accompanying images. Thomson has attributed this to Walter Ledermann.

Cantata entitled 'dalsigre ahi mia dalsigre' by Giovanni Battista Pergolese
|
This manuscript document is The dying advice of a great man, Duncan Forbes of Culloden esq., late Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland. The document is neither placed nor dated, but circa 1750. It purports to be the last words of the judge and politician Duncan Forbes (1685-1747), who rose to be Lord President of the Court of Session and a leading figure in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion. The religious advice in this manuscript is directed to his son. Although this is almost certainly a copy of the original document, it is a curious fact that the writing gets increasingly scrawled towards the end, almost as though the writer were actually approaching the end. The document is folio, 4-pages, and approximately 1300 words.

The collection is composed of, at shelfmark E2009.12, an autograph letter signed 'Roberts' to 'Dear Sir', and marked 'Private'. It is a 3-page letter, headed (embossed) Royal Hospital, Dublin, and dated 18 February 1896. In it, he declines to stand as the Liberal Unionist candidate for the Lord Rectorship of Edinburgh University. He states that, 'The conclusion I have come to, and in which I have reason to believe that the military authorities concur, is that it would be undesirable for an officer holding my position in the Army to stand for an election likely to be contested'. It was Lord Balfour of Burleigh who became the University Rector at Edinburgh in 1896.

The botanist George Taylor was born on 15 February 1904. He was the son of George William Taylor, a painter, and Jane Sloan who had been in domestic service. He was educated first at Bruntsfield School, then at Boroughmuir, and then at George Heriot's School, all in Edinburgh. He studied at Edinburgh University from which he graduated with the degree of B.Sc. (First Class Honours, Botany) in 1926, and with the award of the prestigious biology prize - the Vans Dunlop Scholarship. The University's botanical sciences courses had been delivered at the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh, and while studying there he acquired a wide knowledge of the plants of the world. After his graduation, in 1927-28, he participated in a plant expedition to South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe), and in 1934 he was joint-leader of an expedition to the mountain region of Ruwenzori and other mountainous regions of East Africa. In 1938 he joined Major George Sherriff and Frank Ludlow of the Natural History Museum on an expedition to Bhutan and south eastern Tibet. While in the Himalayas he was able to see the Blue Poppy (Mecanopsis) which had been part of his research and which had culminated in the definitive work about this group of poppies (1934), and for which he was awarded a doctorate (D.Sc., Edinburgh University). During the Second World War, Taylor served as a principal in the Air Ministry between 1940 and 1945, mostly in Harrogate. After the war however he became Deputy Keeper of Botany at the British Museum (Natural History) from 1945 to 1950, then Keeper of Botany there from 1950 until 1956. On the retiral of Sir Edward Salisbury in 1956, he became Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, a post which he held until 1971. In 1962 he was Knighted (award of MBE) in public recognition of the changes and improvements that he had made and set in motion at Kew. Taylor wrote An account of the genus Mecanopsis which was published in 1934, and he had contributed on flowering plants to various periodicals. In addition to receiving many many Honours and Medals he was given an Honorary Dr.Phil. from Gothenburg University, Sweden, in 1958, and an Honorary Doctorate by Dundee University, Scotland, in 1972. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1933, was a member of the Royal Society of Science, Uppsala from 1956, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968. After his retiral from Kew in 1971, Sir George Taylor became Director of the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, a post which he held until the late-1980s when illness made it impossible for him to continue. He died in Dunbar, East Lothian, on 12 November 1993.

The junction of Potterrow (right) looking approximately north, and Bristo Street (left of print) looking northwest. The street, with its eighteenth century buildings, had close associations with Robert Burns. Potterrow, to the right, was a less important thoroughfare, being narrower. In the centre of the picture, at the 'V' formed by the two streets, is an eighteenth century mansion nicknamed the "Ace of Clubs House" because of its distinctive shape; for many years it was a public house. The site of all this area is now Charles Street Car Park, and the wide Potterrow.

Thomson discusses the limitations of intelligence testing, and its positive qualities, citing its objectivity and scientific basis. He outlines the processes involved in trialling the tests to establish their suitability and reliability, describing how the final order and content of the paper is decided; the difficulties involved in obtaining a representative sample of children; the need to incentivise children to do their best in the trial test, and the process of standardisation of test results and the creation of norms for each age group. He also touches upon the relationship between age and test performance within pupils at the same educational level. Thomson describes the distribution of IQ levels shown by such tests, and how teachers might use these to predict and plan for educational attainment.

Contains chiefly correspondence between Sang and individuals within the Agricultural Research Council (ARC); namely the chairman, Lord Victor Rothschild, the secretary, Sir William K. Slater and a senior official, W.G Alexander. Also contains correspondence with colleagues at the genetics section of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation, chiefly Cecil Gordon and C.H Waddington as well as the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Edward Appleton. The papers chiefly concern Sang's details of various grievances within the Organisation and his unhappiness with the conducting of the enquiry and its aftermath. There are also substantial numbers of Sang's drafts of letters (some marked 'Not Sent'), memoranda and notes. Also present are several copies of Sang's 'Memorandum on the affairs of the Genetics Laboratory of the Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation during the period July 1948 to September 1950'. Later correspondence between Sang and the ARC concerns accommodation and equipment issues in the Poultry Research Centre, and arrangements with Sang's students and colleagues.

The philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson was born at Logierait, Perthshire, on 20 June 1723. He was educated at home, locally in Logierait, and in Perth. He studied at St. Andrews University, taking his M.A. in July 1742. Studies in divinity followed, first at St. Andrews, then at Edinburgh University. An army career followed, and then he embarked on a literary career. Briefly Ferguson held the post of Librarian at the Advocates' Library in succession to David Hume (1711-1776). In 1759 he was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University, and in 1764 to the Chair of the now obsolete Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy. In 1778, he was appointed as Secretary to the Commissioners to the American Colonies. Ferguson retired from the Chair of Moral Philosophy in 1785, but so that he could still draw a salary he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. Professor Adam Ferguson died at St. Andrews on 22 February 1816.

William Robinson Pirie was born at the manse of Slains, Aberdeenshire, on 26 July 1804. He studied at University and King's College, Aberdeen, during sessions 1817–21, but did not graduate. He spent some time in a lawyer's office in Aberdeen, but then attended theological classes during sessions 1821–25. He preached in Ellon, Dyce and at Greyfriars' Church in Aberdeen. In 1843 he was appointed Professor of Divinity in Marischal College and University, and in the following year received the honorary degree of D.D., both from Marischal College and from King's College. On the union of the two colleges in 1860 he was assigned the professorship of Divinity and Church History. On the death of Principal Campbell in 1876, Pirie became the resident head of the university, retaining this post until his death. William Robinson Pirie, Professor of Divinity and Principal of the University of Aberdeen, died on 3 November 1885. This letter from Pirie appears to relate to 'Galvanism' and an argument around the subject, or an aspect of it. Galvanism is the contraction of a muscle that is stimulated by an electric current. In physics and chemistry, it is the induction of electrical current from a chemical reaction, typically between two chemicals with differing electronegativities. The effect was named after the scientist Luigi Galvani, who investigated the effect of electricity on dissected animals in the 1780s and 1790s. The modern study of galvanic effects in biology is called electrophysiology, the term galvanism being used only in historical contexts.

Correspondence with Henry Sloane Coffin, 1940-52

The letter was written in St. Petersburg, on Grande Morskaia (Bolshaia Morskaia, or Morskaya Street), on 2nd or 15th May 1901, by W. Sedgefield, and addressed to his 'Dear Uncle', W. J. Sedgefield, Esq., Abingdon, Berkshire, England. The envelope, with franking and partial postage stamp, survives. The letter describes the 'annual spring parade of the troops quartered in and around St. P[etersburg]' which took place 'yesterday' - yesterday being 1 May 1901 - on the 'Field of Mars'. Sedgefield was accompanied by ' an intelligent Russian boy', a pupil of his, and whose male relatives were soldiers - 'fathers and uncles being generals and his brothers officers in crack regiments'. The parade took place in front of the Emperor. 'After a long wait the Emperor appeared riding along side of a state carriage drawn by white horses, containing the two Empresses'. One of these ladies was presumably the Empress Dowager.  The letter contains descriptions of the regiments involved in the parade, and description of the horses involved.

The original plan is so badly crumpled with folding that it is difficult to follow in this imperfect print; but it is a plan showing a series of proposed new roads in Central Edinburgh, and dedicated to the Prince Consort; it must therefore date from before 1861, when he died. These plans, including two semi-circular terraces in Holyrood Park, were never carried out.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters
were previously numbered in pencil, where numbers refer to letters
and not to pages, two letters remain unnumbered. One further letter

Thomson defines educational science, which he sees as having two facets: operational, such as the research undertaken by the Scottish Council for Research in Education regarding the best teaching methods; and fundamental, such as research undertaken to explore the sources of intelligence differences, and their relationship to one another. Thomson charts how educational science has progressed, due in part to the use of mathematical statistics and the increasing use of quantitative measurements. He cites the application of statistical tests to the results of educational experiments to determine their significance as an example. Thomson looks closely at the issue of nature versus nurture, making particular reference to the Scottish Mental Surveys, and studies carried out on siblings and twins. He talks about both the usefulness and limitations of intelligence testing, and the possibilities of factor analysis in identifying the different abilities within an individual's mind. He describes some issues he thinks are worthy of investigation by educational science, including the notion of transfer beyond school, selection for secondary school and further education, techniques for memorising in the classroom, and propaganda in the classroom.

The lecture outlines the aims and purposes of working in a study group and the expectation that each group would study a subject and present it over the course of a lecture to the remainder of the class. Thomson provides guidelines and suggestions for how this should best be done. He also highlights the benefits subsequent wide reading and knowledge will bring to the students.

Beale first joined the John Innes Horticultural Institution (as it was then known), in 1935 as a volunteer assistant, after graduating from Imperial College, London. He was shortly offered paid employment by J.B.S. Haldane, who was then part-time head of the genetics group until 1941. Beale later claimed that 'the appointment at John Innes was a marvellous step forward as the Institution was at that time the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain, rivalled only by Crew's Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh.' Beale's studies encompassed Neurospora and Verbena before he was called up for military service in January 1941.

Thomson acknowledges receipt of Kelley's book, Crossroads in the Minds of Man. He advises Ledermann with regards to referencing Kelley's pentad criterion in his paper, while still recognising Ledermann's shorter method for arriving at the same result.  Thomson cites Psychometrika as the best publication for the paper, and offers to send it there if Ledermann is in agreement.

The letter is dated Doncaster, 26 January 1833, and addressed to Lady Campbell / Barcaldine / Bonaw / Argyleshire. It was written when the young Alexander was 13-years old, and begins, 'My dear Mamma'. The letter writes of making amends and promises to 'write much oftener than I have done previously'; of the 'nice cake' sent to him; and, of the receipt of a letter from Margaret who had said that 'Mary went to shower baths every other day'. The letter tells of how Christmas and New Year was spent, with the teenager going to 'Mrs MacDougall's on the Saturday before Christmas' and going to the Cathedral on Christmas Day. In York, he 'heard the Russian Horn band and went to the Circus and was very much amused with the horses'. The letter goes on to ask how the pony is and supposes that 'he has not been rode much since I left home'. Locally they 'have had some frost here lately and had a little sliding and a few attempts to skate'.

The prolific writer, editor and compiler Josiah Conder was born in Aldersgate, London, on 17 September 1789, the son of a map engraver and bookseller, Thomas Conder. At the age of ten his first essay was published in The Monthly Preceptor, and on reaching thirteen, he began work as an assistant in the family's City bookshop. In 1811, at the age of twenty-one, he took it over. Shortly afterwards, Josiah married Joan Elizabeth Thomas (Eliza Thomas). He had initially formed a literary association with her in 1810 to jointly contribute to the book The associate minstrels. Josiah Conder was a close friend of the engraver and educationalist Isaac Taylor (1759-1829) and his wife, and Conder addressed poems to them both, having been a regular visitor to their home.

The North British Station Hotel, former General Post Office building, with Nelson Monument beyond, and also part of the Old Jail. Register House is on the extreme left. North Bridge with a tram car, and Waverley Station in the foreground. The Waverley Market Hall, the low building rising above the glass roof of the station, was fundamentally an empty hall, but used for shows of all kinds, circuses and sometimes dramatic entertainments. Sometimes there were flower beds on the flat roof. Its interior was quite unlike its successor, the Waverley Market, which dates from 1984/85 and consists of shopping mall at different levels ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam and Walker).

The James Tait Black Memorial Prize was established by the will of Janet Coats (1844-1918), daughter of Thomas Coats, the Glasgow cotton manufacturer, in memory of her late husband, James Tait Black, whom she had married in 1884. James Tait Black (1826-1911) was son of Adam Black the Edinburgh publisher. Two prizes were to be awarded a year, one for fiction and one for biography. Robert Welsh (1874-1960), Janet Coats/Black's solicitor in Ayr, was the formal administrator; the sole judge was to be the Professor of English Literature at Edinburgh University. Sir Herbert John Clifford Grierson (1866-1960) was Professor of English Literature at the University of Edinburgh between 1915 and 1935.

The Ferretti family of Ancona, on the Adriatic, came from Germany in the 14th century. They were men-at-arms. The family enriched themselves in the 17th century during the Wars of Religion in France. The Ferretti family sired military engineers, marine soldiers - Ancona being a base against the Turks - papal diplomatists, a Saint, and a Pope (Pius IX) whose Pontificate from 1846 to 1878 has been the longest in 2000 years. Today, a branch of the Ferretti's of Ancona build powerful leisure craft. The Marche National Archaeological Museum is situated in Ancona's fifteenth century Palazzo Ferretti. This archive of the Ferretti Family begins in 1574 with the last will and testament of the richest man in Ancona at the time 'Il Perillustrissimo Conte Angelo', and closes in the mid-18th century with an impressive marriage and the tale of the family coach.

The Centre for Reproductive Biology stemmed from a proposal made to the University in October 1970 by David T. Baird, Beatty and Anne McLaren in association with Richard V. Short. They argued for the establishment of a multidisciplinary centre for reproductive biology in Edinburgh, in recognition of the increasing role of reproductive biology in medical, agricultural and social problems. Additional impetus was provided when the Medical Research Council invited medical schools throughout Britain to compete for the establishment of a new Unit of Reproductive Biology. The Centre was to incorporate the existing MRC Unit of Reproductive Biology and the independent University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The Centre was housed in a newly constructed building on a site made available by the Regional Hospital Board at the Royal Infirmary, partially with a grant of £266,000 from the Ford Foundation. The delay in the building's completion meant that Beatty was close to retiring by the time of its opening, so in 1977 he withdrew from the Centre.

The Edinburgh Ladies Education Association (ELEA) which was the forerunner of the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW) was founded on 15 October 1868 at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh. The following year, Sophia Jex-Blake won the right for women to attend medical classes in the separate Extra-Mural School. The guiding force behind the setting up of the ELEA however, was Mrs Mary Crudelius who, with others, was able to use combined influence to win the guidance and advice of David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, a prominent supporter of the women's cause. By 1873, women were enrolled in Association classes as diverse as Mathematics, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany and Bible Criticism. In 1874 a University Certificate in Arts was introduced, and by 1877 the Rules and Calendar of the Association were being printed in the University Calendar thus forging the link between the University of Edinburgh and the cause of women's education. With a change in name (to EAUEW) the Association continued to attract students to its classes, and to campaign to obtain a university education for women. In the end, the debate produced the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 which led to the drawing up of Regulations for the Graduation of Women and for their instruction in the Universities, 1892. In 1893 eight women graduated from the University of Edinburgh. They had all been EAUEW students. Right from the start, classes were mixed with the exception of medical ones. With its main objective now achieved, the EAUEW turned to the provision of facilities and amenities for women. By 1897, a library and accommodation for women were available at Masson Hall, at that time located at George Square, Edinburgh. By 1914 more than a thousand women had graduated at the University. The EAUEW was wound up in the 1970s.

Sheep and the Clearances in the Scottish Highlands : a biologist's view
|
The work of Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at Roslin Institute with patented nuclear transfer technology (which included the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 and Polly, a cloned and transgenic sheep, in 1997) opened out a number of possibilities for scientific and medical research. These included the ability to study genetic diseases more effectively in the most appropriate experimental species, to study the basic mechanisms of ageing, to create genetically identical animals for research use, to facilitate the production of novel proteins in livestock and to modify genes in livestock and other experimental animals. These opportunities led to a number of spin-off ventures from Roslin Institute, intended to exploit the commercial, biotechological and medical possibilities of this technology. In 1997, the Institute granted PPL Therapeutics, itself a company established by Roslin, exclusive license to use nuclear transfer technology for the production of therapeutic and medical nutritional proteins in the milk of genetically modified animals - the Institute retained the rights to the jointly owned arising intellectual propert from ongoing research in agricultural and animal breeding areas. In 1998, Roslin created Roslin Bio-Med, a company formed to exploit the cloning technology developed as part of the research which produced Dolly the sheep. In 1999, Roslin Bio-Med was acquired by Geron Corporation.

The poet, Tom Scott, was born in Glasgow on 6 June 1918. He was the son of a Clydeside boilermaker. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the family moved from Glasgow to St. Andrews where an uncle of Tom had a stonemason's business. After a brief apprenticeship to a butcher, Tom became an apprentice stonemason. His poetic spirit first manifested itself in his singing voice (described variously as tenor, or bass). During the Second World War, although a pacifist, he contributed to the war effort - believing that fascism had to be fought against - through his service in the Pay Corps. It was at this time he began to write poetry. Scott's earlier work was in English, and after the war, settling in London, his circle included Kathleen Raine, and Dylan Thomas. Visits to Europe encouraged his Scots poetic voice and he translated the 15th century work of the French poet Villon into Scots. Other work includedSea dirge,The ship,The tree,The dity business, andBrand the builder. In 1966 he completed a Ph.D on the work of William Dunbar which appeared as a book, and he editedThe Penguin book of Scottish verse(1970). In 1963, Scott had married Heather Fretwell and they wrote children's books. Their home was in the Portobello district of Edinburgh. In the 1980s, he contracted myeloma, a rare form of leukaemia, but he survived this. Tom Scott died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 7 August 1995.

The address discusses the apparent schism between scholarship, culture, and vocation, with Thomson making the case that a good education needs to contain aspects of all three in order to produce a whole individual. He illustrates his points with examples of education from around the world.  In relation to this, Thomson discusses the project method, which involves students working together using individual skills, the folkhighschool movement in Denmark, the youth movement in Germany, and the auditorium work present in American high schools.  Thomson argues that everyone is entitled to an education whatever their ability. He stresses that schools do, and should, contain a mixture of students who have access to the same facilities, but whose individual abilities, as well as their interests, are catered to by educators.

The writer of the notebook which forms this collection was probably a law student. In addition to a part-copy of the transcript of the trial of Captain John Porteous in 1736, there are other notes on legal matters, aphorisms and religious references. The notebook is rather like a commonplace book. What transpired as the lynching of Captain John Porteous in 1736 was another shocking incident in Edinburgh's dark history. Porteous had been captain of the city guard of Edinburgh when one Andrew Wilson, a smuggler, was hanged on 14 April 1736. The crowd sympathised with Wilson and a riot started. Porteous ordered the guard to fire above the heads of the mob and in so doing onlookers from adjacent tenements were shot and injured. This enraged the mob even more and Porteous took the extreme measure of ordering his troops to fire on the people, killing six. Porteous was tried and convicted for murder, but seemed likely to be spared the death penalty. Popular feeling ran so high that a mob stormed the old Tolbooth Prison on 7 September 1736 and took Porteous to be beaten, repeatedly hung and let down, and eventually killed. No-one was ever punished for the riot, but the Provost of Edinburgh was dismissed for failing to manage his turbulent city.

The 'Donaldson report' was a report from an expert group established by the government and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson. The group was asked to undertake an assessment of the anticipated benefits of new areas of research using human embryos, the risks and alternatives, and ultimately, to advise whether these new areas of research should be permitted. The report, 'Stem Cell Research: medical progress with responsibility', was published by the Department of Health in June 2000. The report concluded that research was warranted across a range of sources of stem cells, and that it did not raise any new ethical issues different from those already raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research. The report was followed by a response from the government in August 2000, which accepted all the report's recommendations and undertook to introduce regulations to extend the permitted research purposes under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and to set out unequivocally in legislation the existing ban on reproductive cloning.

Hugh Marwick was born on 30 November 1881 on Rousay, Orkney Islands. He went to school at Sourin on Rousay. In 1900 he studied to be a teacher at the Free Church Training College for Teachers in Aberdeen, after which he was appointed to the primary school at Newbattle, near Dalkeith, in Midlothian. Evening study followed to enable him to attain the necessary qualifications to study at Edinburgh University, where he first matriculated in 1905. He was awarded the degree of M.A. in 1909, with First Class Honours in English. After graduation Marwick obtained a post as Chief English Master at the Grammar School in Burnley, Lancashire where he met his wife Jane Barritt. They were married in 1914 just after he had been appointed headmaster of the Burgh (now known as the Grammar) School in Kirkwall. During his time as headmaster of the Burgh School, he completed his D.Litt. (Edinburgh). His thesis presented in 1926 was on the original form of 'The Orkney Norn', and this would serve as the basis for a book. After fifteen years as a headmaster, Marwick was appointed Executive Officer to the Orkney Education Committee - in effect, Director of Education, and it was for his services to education in Orkney that he was admitted Companion of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1938. Marwick retired at the age of sixty-five in 1946.  Dr Marwick was one of the founders of the Orkney Antiquarian Society in 1922 and was its Secretary for 17 years, during which he contributed papers to its Proceedings. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. In addition to a large number of papers for the Orkney Antiquarian Society, he also contributed papers - mainly about finds in Orkney - to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. His published works include The Orkney Norn (1929), and posthumously Orkney Farm-Names (1952).  Dr Hugh Marwick died in Kirkwall on 21 May 1965.

Thomson stresses that he does not wish Ledermann to reply to the letter while his Mother is visiting. He refers to a manuscript he sent Ledermann regarding the connection between estimation and selection, outlining a point he can add to it and referring to matrices of Aitken's.  He discusses orthogonal projection, estimation of regression, the selection formulae, and how these can be seen as one; as well as the division of factorial analysis after selection into two parts.

David Brewster was born in Jedburgh on 11 December 1781, and was attending Edinburgh University classes at the age of twelve in 1793. It was his ambition to go into the Church. Indeed, Brewster gave his first sermon in March 1804 but nervousness led him to abandon this career. That year he became tutor to a family in Dumfriesshire and he remained there until 1807 while he pursued scientific studies and the study of literature.  In 1807, Brewster was a candidate for the Chair of Mathematics at St. Andrews University, but without success. In 1813, he submitted a paper to the Royal Society of London on Some properties of light and the same year he published a Treatise on new philosophical instruments. In 1814, illness prompted him to visit Paris and Geneva and on his return to Britain he continued publishing. In 1815, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1816, Brewster invented the kaleidoscope and although he patented the invention, it was quickly pirated because of a fault in the registration. He published his Treatise on the kaleidoscope in 1819.  Together with the mineralogist Professor Robert Jameson, he edited the Edinburgh philosophical journal, previously called the Edinburgh magazine, and in 1819 when the name changed again to the Edinburgh journal of science he was the sole editor. In 1820, Brewster became a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and in 1821 he was active in the formation of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts of which he became director. In 1822, he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In December 1837, he became the Principal of the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard at St. Andrews University. In 1859 he became Principal of Edinburgh University. Sir David Brewster died from an attack of pneumonia at Allerly, Melrose, on 10 February 1868.

Thomson outlines the structure of the course and describes what is expected of the students, the value of practical experience, and the difficulties of offering practical experience alongside teaching on a training course. He also discusses the problem of practical experience impinging on written work and study, and how students can manage their time accordingly. Thomson describes the importance of ensuring the knowledge the students have of various classes is brought together, and how important it is that they should not be studied in isolation. He emphasises the importance of understanding key tenets of sociology in relation to education, coming to the course with an open mind, and learning from each other. He also includes a quotation from James Maxwell outlining the function of the Training College in ensuring a synthesis of the students' knowledge takes place.

In the first letter, dated 28 Oct 1939 and numbered 12 (39), Thomson refers to Ledermann's manuscript, which he had originally enclosed with some deletions suggested by a referee. These have not survived in the collection. He tells Ledermann that he is unsure if Professor Kendall will apply for a Carnegie Grant, or if Thomson or Ledermann will have to. In the second letter, dated 15 Nov 1939 and numbered 12 a (39), Thomson invites Ledermann to tea and refers him again to the articles by E B Wilson and Jane Worcester, in particular two matrices of loadings which they use and which Thomson transcribes. He informs Ledermann that his son, Hector Thomson, will be continuing with his work in Nicosia.

Correspondence between Beatty and Robert G. Edwards chiefly concerning the publicity surrounding in vitro fertilisation
|
The manuscript materialLe Thresor des Divines et Celestes Consolations'(London, 1643) was bound by 'Lord Herbert's Binder'. It contains 21 chapters on the nature and benefits of Afflictions. A rough translation of the introduction gives the flavour: 'Friendly Reader, this book, to which I have given light, shows how tribulations tear us away from sin, which is the source and origin of all pain; it brings us to virtue, to good, and to God, who is the means, the Principle, indeed who is in Himself all the Sovereign good. And afterwards it produces the means to keep always on the right path of virtue, eases our path towards Heaven, and forces us through a secret violence and voluntary constraints, despising that which is of the world (holding its voluptuousness, its delights and vanities against one's will and in disgust) and to breathe towards Heaven, with tears in the eyes, sighs on the lips and sobs in the heart.' The volume is dedicated to Edward Montagu, 2nd. Earl of Manchester (1602-1671), the Presbyterian and a Parliamentary leader. Manchester had succeeded his father as 2nd. Earl of Manchester in November 1642. In August 1643 he was appointed Sergeant-Major-General of the Associated Counties of East Anglia.

Thomson discusses how habit creates dexterity, referring particularly to the playing of a musical instrument, and the premise that frequent practice is more beneficial than long practice.  He discusses the importance of challenging students and ensuring the level of attainment results in an increase in the level of difficulty; and he compares the effectiveness of the entire and parts methods of memorising, in relation to music practice.

Alan Owen was born in Inverness on 2 September 1922. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy. At the time of starting studies at Edinburgh University in 1939, his family still lived in Inverness. At University he followed classes in English and British History between 1939 and 1940, English and Philosophy from 1940 to 1941, then Latin, Psychology and Geography from 1941 to 1942.

She graduated in January 1945, and was awarded a Diploma in Social Study in 1947. Both Alan Owen and Anne Hyslop Gemmell were members and associates of the XIIth International Congress of Pyschology held in Edinburgh at the University of Edinburgh between 23 July and 29 July 1948.

The first one dated 23 November 1915, and discusses a letter Edwards sent to the Glasgow Herald to 'give pause to [his] municipal rulers'; Fleming adds 'it is amazing how callous town councils can be in the destruction of historical buildings which they ought to cherish and proect'. The second letter, dated 16 February 1916 is much shorter, and simply states: 'the enclosed is from a proof which I have been correcting today. You may like to have it' (enclosure is missing).

He was Captain of the University's Association Football XI (a soccer Blue), and he played for Queen's Park Football Club, Glasgow. He earned business experience in London with import and export merchants and bankers. Between 1939 and 1967 Stevens was Director and Secretary of Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures. He was also the University Rector's Assessor and served on the University Court for five years from 1952. In 1972 he was appointed Editor of the University of Edinburgh Journal and in 1979 he held the dual offices of Honorary Secretary and Honorary Editor of the title. William Victor Stevens was a J.P. and he was awarded the O.B.E.

The volume has the armorial book-plate of George Brock M.D. (Georgius Brock M.D.). The text in the volume begins with a quotation from Cullen, so the author of the manuscript was doubtless a follower or student of Cullen whose name is invoked several times subsequently. To begin with the text is concerned with materia medica and the nutritional qualities of foodstuffs. later the text is more various, with topics including physiology and also asphyxiation. A dispute within the Royal College of Physicians is discussed. There are also notes on natural history and geology. At the end of the volume are a few pages of 'original poetry' dated 1821 and in various hands identified by initials.

Between 1943 and 1945, Thompson set about keeping a personal wartime journal hoping to register possible changes to his psychological make-up. The journal offers data on the effects of long-term overseas service amongst officers. The journal is in diary form with 9 volumes, covering the period 18 July 1943 to 15 October 1945, and written while in North Africa, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Austria. Within the diaries are newspaper cuttings of the period, photographs, franked envelopes, and other inserted materials. The collection also includes printed matter in the form of New Zealand Law Reports (1962, 1963), New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, press-cuttings relating to Thompson v. Turbott (1961-1965), and material relating to a Public Service Appeal.

This collection of 3,465 glass positive slides were acquired from the Roslin Institute in November 2009 as part of a larger accession of material. The slides, which range in date from the 1870s to the 1930s, cover a wide range of subjects; photographs of indigenous peoples from around the world, international travel scenes, personal portraits (frequently of figures connected with the natural/veterinary/agricultural sciences), images and portraits of domestic animals (chiefly sheep, poultry, cows and pigs), illustrations and extracts from books, articles and newspapers. The majority of the slides are black and white, although some are hand-coloured or tinted. Many of the slides were produced by T.J. Walls, an optician on Forrest Road, Edinburgh.  It is thought that at least a proportion of the collection was created or collected by James Cossar Ewart as well as Robert Wallace, in their capacities as professors of, respectively, Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, and were probably used for teaching and illustrative purposes. Both Ewart and Wallace appear (separately) in the slides, as do colleagues and other persons known to both or either of the men. While some of the slides appear to be directly associated with Ewart and/or Wallace, it is supposed that a proportion of the collection may have been sent to them by colleagues from around the world. It is not known how the collection ultimately came to reside at the Roslin Institute.

James Fleetwood was baptised at Chalfont St. Giles on 25 April 1603. He was educated at Eton and then at King's College, Cambridge. In 1632 he was appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Lichfield. During the Civil War in England, Fleetwood attached himself as Chaplain to the regiment of John, Earl of Rivers, and his contribution during the Battle of Edgehill earned him from King Charles the degree of D.D. from Oxford in November 1642. He was then given the Rectory of Sutton Coldfield but this was later withdrawn from him by Parliament. He was made tutor to Prince Charles, and on the Restoration he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary. He was also given the Rectory of Anstey in Hertfordshire and of Denham in Buckinghamshire. In 1663 and 1667 Fleetwood was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, and on 29 August 1675 he was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester at the Church of St. Peter le Poer, Broad Street, London. James Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester, died on 17 July 1683.

James Orchard Halliwell was born in Sloane Street, in London's Chelsea, on 21 June 1820. He was educated at private schools, and showed an aptitude for mathematics. In his teen years, he began to collect books and manuscripts. In November 1837 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in April 1838 he transferred to Jesus College. There, he was awarded a mathematical prize and scholarship, and he acted as Librarian. In 1839, before he was nineteen years of age, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and then Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1840, Halliwell left Cambridge after the Lent term, without a degree, and settled in London. By then, he had collected around 130 early manuscripts, mainly dealing with mathematics and astrology, but these had to be sold under pressure from creditors. In London he worked in the Library of the British Museum and continued buying books and manuscripts. It was his purchase and collection of manuscripts that, in 1844, led to serious charges against him of abstracting material from Trinity College. Throughout his life, he was an insatiable collector of rare books and manuscripts. Halliwell was also an energetic member of the many literary societies founded at the time - the Camden Society, the Percy Society, the Shakespeare Society. To the latter he contributed many short essays. In 1841, Halliwell came to the attention of antiquary and bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872). He soon became a house guest and in 1842 Halliwell married the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Phillipps, after which he assumed the name of James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps. Also at this time, he began to concentrate his attention on the life of Shakespeare and the text of Shakespeare's works. His publication record as a whole includes works on archaeology, folklore, balladry, philology, and history, and some notable works areA brief account of the life, writings and inventions of Sir Samuel Morland: master of mechanics to Charles the Second(1838),An introduction to the Midsummer Night's Dream, an essay on the character of Falstaff and Shakesperiana(1841),Dictionary of archaic and provincial words, obsolete phrases, proverbs, and ancient customs from the fourteenth century(1846),New boke about Shakespeare and Stratford-upon-Avon(1850),The complete works of Shakspere: revised from the original editions(1850), andOutlines of a life of Shakespeare(1881). In the course of his literary researches he often had occasion to communicate with David Laing (1793-1878), historian, antiquary, bibliographer, and collector. James O. Halliwell-Phillipps died on 3 January 1889.

      MS memorandum (pp.11) titled Field conveyance for the sick and wounded signed J. S. Login, and dated 30 June 1857, Castle Menzies, Perthshire. The document outlines Login's idea and the approaches made to the War Office and the subsequent bureaucratic referrals. The War Office subsequently undertook the manufacture of a 'blessiere' to the design for testing purposes. Login refers to the parade where the first Victoria Crosses were awarded and notes the sufferings of the wounded soldiers who were badly jolted in their hospital litters in the march-past.
      Letter from the War Department, to 'Sir John Logan / Roehampton', dated 9 April 1855, informing him that Lord Panmure has indicated 'that two Blessieres have been constructed' according to his design 'and that they are now ready for inspection'.
      Letter from the Royal Carriage Department, Woolwich, to 'Sir John Logan / Roehampton', dated 28 April 1855, informing him of 'the formation of a Committee of Officers for the consideration of Hospital Conveyances' and that a meeting will take place on 2 may [1855].
      Memorandum on the nature of litters for the use of the army in the Crimea and the different ways they could be used in the field - e.g. on wagons, on gun limbers - and their possible adaption for shipboard use.

Thomson discusses the need for education to benefit both the individual and the wider community (or civilisation). He defines intelligence and intelligence testing, and compares the Scottish and English systems to each other and to America. Ultimately, he argues that schools should contain a mixture of intelligence levels, with education catered to each child, which will in turn create a unified society.

Prior to the foundation of the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education in 1970, governance of postgraduate medical education in Scotland was carried out by regional committees drawn from the Royal Colleges, University medical schools and the National Health Service. Following the Royal Commission on Medical Education report (often called the Todd Report) in 1968, the Scottish Council on Postgraduate Medical Education (SCPME) was established in 1970 with the purpose of co-ordinating, funding and advising on postgraduate education and training in hospitals, general practice and clinical psychology in Scotland.  In October 1992 the SCPME was reconstituted as the Scottish Council for Postgraduate and Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), and in 1993 it became a Special Health Board of the NHS. NHS Education for Scotland was established as a Special Health Board by Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 103, The NHS Education for Scotland Order 2002. The staff and functions of SCPMDE, including the South East of Scotland Postgraduate Medical Deanery, transferred to the new body in April 2002, together with those of the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting and the Post Qualification Education Board for NHS Pharmacists in Scotland.

The English composer, music journalist and pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji on 14 August 1892 in Chingford, Essex. He was the son of a Parsi father and a Spanish-Sicilian mother. As a composer Sorabji was self-taught. As a critic Sorabji was connected to the radical weekly New Age magazine which had been taken over by Alfred Richard Orage, and to New English Weekly. His music criticism was notable for its acerbity and wit, and also for championing - at the time - unfashionable composers such as Mahler and Szymanowski. His own works were of great complexity, and he played them in London and Paris in 1921 and in Vienna in 1922. Thereafter he discouraged public performance of his music until relenting in the mid-1970s. He remained something of a cult figure however. His works included the Symphonic High Mass (1955-1961), the massive (four-hour), multi-movement Opus clavicembalisticum (1930), and the Etudes transcendantes (1940-1944).  Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji died at Winfrith Newburgh, near Dorchester, in Dorset on 15 October 1988. He had been a friend of the composer Alistair Hinton, who was the founder of the Sorabji Archive. In 1994 many of his original manuscripts went to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basle, Switzerland.

Sir James Crichton-Browne MD FRS was a leading British psychiatrist and medical psychologist. He is famous for studies on the relationship of mental illness to brain injury and for the development of public health policies in relation to mental health. He was also a celebrated author and orator. he was knighted in 1886. Crichton-Browne was born in Edinburgh on 29 November 1840. His parents were William Alexander Francis Browne (1805–1885) and Magdalene Howden Balfour, daughter of Dr Andrew Balfour of Edinburgh. The addition of Crichton to James's surname was derived from his godmother, Elizabeth Crichton, of Friars Carse, near Dumfries, whose family were instrumental in the financing of the Crichton Institution, Dumfries, where his father was medical superintendent (1838 to 1857). The young James spent much of his childhood at the Crichton. He went to school at Dumfries Academy and then to Trinity College, Glenalmond. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and qualified MRCS in 1861, and MD in 1862 with a thesis on hallucinations. Crichton-Browne was elected one of the undergraduate Presidents of the Royal Medical Society and, in this capacity, he argued for the place of psychology in the medical curriculum. He worked as an assistant physician in asylums in Exeter, Warwick and Derby, and a brief period on Tyneside. He was appointed Physician-Superintendent of the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at Wakefield in 1866, and he stayed there for ten years. In 1875, Crichton-Browne was appointed as Lord Chancellor's Visitor in Lunacy, a position which involved the regular examination of Chancery patients throughout England and Wales. This post was held until his retirement in 1922 and he combined it with the development of an extensive London consulting practice. In 1878, Crichton-Browne became President of the Medico-Psychological Association, and in 1883, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (one of his proposers had been Charles Darwin). He also served as Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Institution from 1889 till 1926. He served as President of the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Natural History and Antiquarian Society from 1892 to 1896 as well. In 1908, he joined the Board of the Bovril Company. Crichton-Browne was editor of the West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports (1871-1876); he corresponded and collaborated with Charles Darwin; and his most important scientific paper was On The Weight of the Brain (1879). In 1920, Crichton-Browne delivered the first Maudsley Lecture to the Royal Medico-Psychological Association at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. Other works were: Victorian Jottings (1926); What the Doctor Thought (1930); The Doctor's Second Thoughts (1931); and, The Doctor's Afterthoughts (1932).  Sir James Crichton-Browne died in Dumfries on 31 January 1938, at the age of 97.

First edition. 1946. Octavo. 11 sheets (13 x 17.5 cm) of fine art paper preserved in a marbled paper folder comprising a decorated title-page followed by the text, with a pen-and-ink drawing at the tope of each page (save the last which closes with a decorated 'Finis'). One of the drawings has been coloured. The illustrations are typical of Mclaren's illustrative at its finest. The initials on the back ('HM') would seem to suggest that this is the recipient of the portfolio. The drawings include those illustrating: the 'shore of silver-streaming Thames'; a 'flock of nymphs [...] each one had a little wicker basket's; the 'two swans of goodly hue'; the 'nymphs, which now had flowers their fill'; the 'baskets [...] store of flowers'; a spray of flowers being perhaps 'the world's fair ornament'; nymphs, swans and flowers; 'Sweet Thames' with skyline and bridge; Queen Elizabeth, 'Great England's glory and the world's wide wonder'; and, the 'Finis' in which 'I end my song'.

Three copies of manuscript letters from Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) to Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji are dated 25 May 1926 from Montrose, 5 January 1932 from London, and 19 August 1955 from Lanarkshire. The letter from 25 May 1926 had been sent to Sorabji through the New Age. Grieve writes that 'I should have written you long ere this, but for the Strike, which involved me in all kinds of difficulties and while it lasted completely monopolised my time and thoughts'. He refers to having received 'a copy of your great Organ Symphony'. Grieve goes on to say that he hopes 'that I may yet, either in London or Glasgow, be so fortunate as to have an evening or two with you on the piano'. The letter from 5 January 1932 thanks Sorabji for 'so magnificent a dedication and presentation copy'. The item was 'a stupendous volume - marvellously printed'. Grieve goes on to say that 'Of the stupendous power of the compostion, and the certainty of its eventual recognition - as of your work and place as a whole - I am equally satisfied, albeit keen to see the latter expedited. You have had to stay far too long in the wilderness overshadowed by placemen and morons. But your day will come and surely cannot be long delayed now'. The letter was written at a time of trials for Grieve who is 'bogged in a mass of private troubles of all kinds (including a divorce suit ... which culminates this month'. The letter from 19 August 1955 refers to Sorabji's 'words of appreciation, generous as ever, of my Joyce poem'. Grieve agrees with Sorabji' 'regarding English poetry which in the main I detest'. He again writes of how he knows 'no parallel to your case in sheer lack of due recognition'.

Carnegie Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training opened in Dunfermline on the 4th October 1905. The Andrew Carnegie Trust founded it as a training college for women students of Physical Education. In 1908 the college was opened to men and in 1909 it was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as a central institution for the purpose of the Education (Scotland) Act 1908. Between 1913-14 new accommodation were built, and the college was renamed Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Education (DCHPE). From 1931 only women students were trained at DCHPE - the male students being transferred to Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow. Between 1939-46 the staff and students of the college were temporarily transferred to the Teachers Training Centre in Aberdeen, its buildings being commandeered by the navy during World War II. In 1950 the College transferred to Woolmanhill, Aberdeen, due to over-crowding problems at the other site. Hygiene was then dropped from the name of the college and the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust severed connections since the College was no longer based in Dunfermline. A Board of Governors was established for the College in 1959, and in 1966 the College (now just DCPE) transferred to newly built specialist accommodation at Cramond, Edinburgh. In 1986 it was announced that the training of physical education teachers - male and female - would be centralised at Cramond. In 1987 DCPE merged with Moray House College of Education and the male students then at Jordanhill College transferred to the enlarged Moray House at the same time. The combined expertise provided the core of the Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies (SCOPEMALS) at Moray House, Cramond Campus. In 1998 Moray House Institute of Education together with its Cramond Campus became the Faculty of Education of the University of Edinburgh. The University closed the Cramond Campus over the summer of 2001 and the students, staff and facilities relocated to the refurbished St Leonard's Land at Holyrood, part of The Moray House School of Education of the University. During the period at Cramond, one of the students there in the late-1960s was Diana Kerr Hastings.  Diana Kerr Hastings was born in Argyll in 1949, and moved to Angus aged 6. Between 1967 and 1970 she studied at Dunfermline College of Physical Education (DCPE), Cramond. This was at a time when students were expected to take up in-house accommodation in their 1st year, could take approved lodgings in their 2nd year, and had the choice of being resident or non-resident (being 'in' or 'out') in their 3rd year . Some students too began to flat-share, but this had to be with other DCPE students and even then, as Mrs Hastings has noted 'even those pioneers of indepndent living were told they would not be allowed into sick bay if they were ill'. During her three year course she represented the College in athletics, badminton, lacrosse, netball and orienteering. She was also the College netball secretary and she went on to serve as Liaison Officer for Scottish Netball when they played their Home International matches at Meadowbank, Edinburgh, in the 1970s. In 1970, she graduated from DCPE with the Diploma of Physical Education, with Merit in Professional Subjects. Between 1970 and 1972 she taught in Kirriemuir, Angus, and later on moved back to Edinburgh and taught at St. Giles School for the Hearing Impaired until 1976. From 1992 she retrained in Paediatric Audiology working initially in Lothian Region schools, and then for the NHS until her retirement in June 2009. In 2010, Diana Kerr Hastings attended a 40th Anniversary gathering of graduating students (from the 1967-1970 course).

The amounts involved are huge, with the account of revenues in hand running to over £70,000 towards the end of the period. The manuscript volume itself is composed of a short alphabetic table of names, then from folio 1, accounts dating from 1 August 1662, Edinburgh, to 7 September 1671, Edinburgh, at folio 221. Towards the rear of the volume are another set of accounts and revenues and interests on 87 folios.

Geoffrey Beale was Ian Gibson's PhD supervisor between 1960 and1963. They published three collaborative papers on Paramecium from 1961 and postulated a new concept, the 'metagon', envisaged as a stable RNA-containing cytoplasmic entity necessary for the maintenance of bacterium-like 'mu' particles (this theory was later invalidated). Gibson later worked with Beale's old mentor, Tracy Sonneborn, at Indiana University before moving to the University of East Anglia where he established a protozoan genetics research group. He was the first to establish homologies between different taxonomic groupings of protozoa.

The geographer Professor Thomas Walter Freeman was born on 27 December 1908 in Congleton, Cheshire. Between 1922 and 1926 Freeman attended grammar schools in Nantwich, Cheshire and at Bridgend, South Wales. In 1927 he entered the University of Leeds and in 1930 graduated with a first-class honours degree in geography, followed in 1931 by a Diploma of Education. He served as a Lecturer in the Geography Department of Edinburgh University, 1933-1936, and in 1934 he assumed some editorial responsibilities for the Scottish Geographical Magazine. Freeman then moved to Trinity College, Dublin, where he initiated an honours course in geography and began research on Irish population patterns. During the Second World War, between 1941 and 1945 he worked part-time at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge as assistant to P. M. Roxby, who was preparing Admiralty handbooks on China. In 1950 Freeman became Reader in Geography at Manchester University - and then Professor in 1974 - and he remained at Manchester until his retirement in 1976. His publications included Ireland: a Regional Geography  (1950), Geography and Planning (1958), The Conurbations of Great Britain (1959), and Geography and Regional Administration (1968). Professor Thomas Walter Freeman died on 11 March 1988

A number of changes had been observed in ruminant offspring following the transfer to recipients of embryos subjected to a variety of treatments, including in vitro culture. The first of these changes to be noted was an increase in size at birth, which sometimes prejudiced the survival of both mother and offspring. This phenomenon became known as 'Large Offspring Syndrome', which was first described in 1991 after the production of calves by nuclear transfer by Steen Willasden. The aim of these research projects was to establish culture systems which support the development of cattle embryos reliably and at high frequency, without causing Large Offspring Syndrome; to identify potential genetic markers in the pre-implantation embryo which might predict an oversize foetus, and to study embryo development and different culture systems. Research was carried out with sheep and cattle by Roslin Institute in collaboration with the Scottish Agricultural College and the Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen. The project 'Manifestation of increased foetal size at birth' was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and 'Factors affecting foetal size in ruminants' was funded by the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department.

Gerald Henry Elliot was born in Edinburgh on 24 December 1923. His parents were Captain J. S. Elliot RN and Magda Salvesen. He was educated at Marlborough College and then he studied at New College, Oxford, where he graduated with the degree of BA PPE in 1948. During the Second World War, he served as a Captain with the FF Rifles, Indian Army (Frontier Force), 1942-1946. Elliot joined the family firm of Christian Salvesen and Company in 1948 and quickly became involved in its whaling operations, making his first trip to South Georgia just two months after his appointment. He slowly took over the management of the whaling fleet from his uncle, Harold Salvesen, and was involved in improving processing methods, the rationalisation of whale catches, ordering of supplies and overseeing recruitment. In 1950, he married Margaret Ruth Whale, daughter of the Rev. J. S. Whale. Following the cessation of whaling in the 1960s Elliot became involved in Salvesen's fishing interests in South America. He retired from the company (Christian Salvesen plc) in 1988 having been its Chairman since 1981. He was knighted in 1986. His wife, Lady Elliot, has also been honoured, receiving an MBE in 1993. In October 2007, the French based transport and logistics provider Norbert Dentressangle announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Christian Salvesen. It has been observed that the decision of the Salvesen firm, chaired by Sir Gerald H. Elliot, to sell two disused whaling stations on South Georgia to Constantino Davidoff, an Argentinean scrap merchant, led inadvertently to the Falkland islands conflict. When an Argentinean scrap team arrived at South Georgia in March 1982 it was aboard an Argentinean warship. The Argentinean flag was raised on South Georgia and Argentinean troops seized the Falklands two weeks later. In 1998 Sir Gerald published A Whaling Enterprise: Salvesen in the Antarctic detailing the history of Salvesen's whaling interests, the lives of whalers and the technical and economic frameworks which supported the industry. He has also written papers on the control of whaling and fishing, arts administration and economic management. Sir Gerald Elliot has also been a Director of the Scottish Provident Institution, 1971-1989, and then Chairman 1983-1989, and Chairman of the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust, 1987-1994. He has been a Trustee of the National Museums of Scotland, 1987-1991, and a member of the Court, Edinburgh University, 1984-1993. He has held many other positions too in commerical and public organisations. In addition to his knighthood awarded in 1986, Sir Gerald is also a Knight First Class of the Order of the White Rose of Finland.

Bruce Henderson Kenrick, clergyman and housing campaigner, was born 18 January 1920 in Aintree, Liverpool, the son of an accountant. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School in Crosby. During the Second World War he served with the Army Medical Corps in West Africa - in the Gold Coast, now Ghana - and then with the Eighth Army and the Parachute Brigade in Italy. After the war he began studies in Medicine at Edinburgh University but during his studies he became involved with the Christian Union which led to his switching courses to Theology. He was awarded the degree of B.D. on 9 July 1954. Also in 1954, Kenrick married Isabel Witte, a Bostonian. After his ordination as a Presbyterian minister in 1961 - the Church of Scotland - he continued his studies at Princeton Theological Seminary and joined the ecumenical ministry of the East Harlem Protestant Parish (EHPP) which was involved in promoting a Christian response to rising racial tensions. Between 1956 and 1959, Kenrick served as a missionary in Bengal - in Calcutta - where he and his wife supported local movements for land reform. However, when he contracted typhoid in India they returned to the UK. The family then moved to Iona in the west of Scotland where he had become a member of the Iona Community - an ecumenical community created by the Rev. George MacLeod in 1938. Between 1962 and 1980 the Kenricks were in Notting Hill, London, where he worked with an ecumenical group ministry modelled on the EHPP. In 1963, while in Notting Hill, he established the Notting Hill Housing Trust after becoming appalled at the housing conditions in the area Kenrick's work in Notting Hill inspired him to found the housing charity Shelter which was launched in 1966 as a national campaigning body for housing. The charity was given a huge boost by the public outcry after the BBC screening of the Ken Loach film Cathy come home. Kenrick was then able to persuade the Labour government of Harold Wilson to introduce legislation to provide funding for housing associations to enable them to buy and renovate run-down properties, and also for a rent rebate scheme for poorer tenants. In 1980, Kenrick was appointed as a minister in the United Reformed Church in Bayswater. Later still, he moved to another ministry in Hackney before retiring to Iona where he often served as a locum minister. Prior to that, in 1983, he became divorced from his wife. Kenrick's publication record includes The new humanity (1956), Come out the wilderness (1962) which was his account of his experience with the EHPP, and which carried a foreword written by the Rev. Trevor Huddleston, and A man from the interior (1980) which was written after a visit to Cuba and in which he argued that Communism and Christianity could co-exist. The Rev. Bruce Henderson Kenrick died 15 January 2007 in Oban, aged 86.

This is the entrance to the Camera Obscura on the fifth floor of the Outlook Tower. This roof-top pavilion was constructed in 1850 to the design of Marie Therese Short to house her Victorian optical instrument, and was originally called "Short's Observatory". Geddes bought the whole building in 1892 and changed the name to "The Outlook Tower". The "Biological Room" appears to have been formed by covering the roof-top terrace with a temporary cover to protect the plants, of which some are shown here.

Duncan Forbes was born on 10 November 1685, the second son of Duncan Forbes of Culloden and Bunchrew, near Inverness. He went to Edinburgh University to study law, but in 1705 proceeded to Leiden instead to study civil law and oriental languages, returning to Scotland in 1707. He was admitted as an advocate in 1709, and was also appointed Sheriff of Midlothian around the same time. During the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, his brother John Forbes (who had joined with Simon Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat) accompanied him to Inverness where they raised forces in support of the government. Duncan was rewarded with the office of Depute-Advocate which he took up in 1716. In 1721-22, Forbes was MP for Ayr, and in 1722 he was returned in Inverness. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Advocate in succession to Robert Dundas of Arniston. As the English system of taxation was extended into Scotland troubles began to arise and rioting took place in Glasgow in 1725. Forbes accompanied a force commanded by General Wade, and the Glasgow magistrates were arrested for their negligence and brought to Edinburgh with some of the rioters. They were later freed. Edinburgh too suffered trouble within the brewing industry at this time. In 1735, Forbes succeeded to the family estates on the death of his brother. In 1737 he opposed the Bill bringing penalties on the City of Edinburgh after the Porteous Riots. In the wake of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, he protested against the cruelties of the Duke of Cumberland. Duncan Forbes died on 10 December 1747.

Thomson writes to Ledermann regarding the method of sums of differences, which Thomson uses frequently in his work but with which Ledermann is unfamiliar.  He refers Ledermann to a 1909 paper of Spearman's in which the method was first used, and explains the form of the method he himself has used since, which he refers to as the pooling square. He goes on to discuss Hotelling's paper on the most predictable criterion in the Journal of Educational Psychology.

Marie Laurencin was born in Paris on 31 October 1883. She attended the Lycee Lamartine in the city before studying porcelain painting at the Sevres factory. Later on she entered the Academie Humbert. In 1907 she exhibited at the Clovis Sagot gallery in Montmartre, and there she was introduced to Guillaume Apollinaire by Pablo Picasso and she became romatically involved with Apollinaire until 1913. In 1908, Laurencin achieved her first sale when Gertrude Stein purchasedGroup of artists. This group portrait of Laurencin, Apollinaire, and Picasso and his mistress became the theme of a larger version in 1909 entitledApollinaire and his friends. In 1911 she exhibited in the Salon des Independants, and she began illustrating books. The ending of her relationship with Apollinaire in 1913 also saw the end of her Cubist-inspired period. In 1913, Laurencin established a contract with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg which would last until 1940, and in 1914 she married the German Baron, Otto von Waetjen. On the outbreak of war however they fled to Spain and spent time in Madrid and Barcelona, and then also to Germany. In 1921 she returned to Paris and in the same year she divorced von Waetjen. The early-1920s saw Laurencin designing sets and costumes most notably for the Ballets Russes -Les Biches- as well as painting society portraits including that of Coco Chanel. In the 1930s she was teaching at the art academy, Villa Malakoff. In 1942 she publishedLe Carnet des nuits. In 1944, her apartment on Rue Savorgnan de Brazza was requisitioned by the Germans and she did not get it back until 1953. Marie Laurencin died in Paris on 8 June 1956 and she was buried in the cemetary Pere Lachaise.

The Scottish poet and novelist George Mann MacBeth was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, on 19 January 1932. When he was three, his family moved to Sheffield and he was educated at King Edward VII School in the city, before studying at New College, Oxford, with an Open Scholarship in Classics.  On graduating from Oxford, he joined BBC Radio in 1955, working as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the BBC Third Programme, until 1976. He would then resign from the BBC to take up novel writing, and he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury. After a divorce from his first wife, he married the novelist Lisa St Aubin de Terán (b. 1953), and then after a second divorce, he moved with his third wife to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, dying with this in 1992. His work spans four decades and includes: A Form of Words (1954); the editing of the Penguin Book of Sick Verse (1963), and of the Penguin Book of Animal Verse (1965), and the Penguin Book of Victorian Verse (1969); Missile Commander (1965); Shrapnel (1972); the thriller The Samurai (1976); the thriller Cadbury and the Samurai  (1981); The Long Darkness (1984); Trespassing. Poems from Ireland (1991); and, the novel The Testament of Spencer (1992). In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. His Poems from Oby (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society. Macbeth received a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for his work.  George Mann Macbeth died in Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland on 13 February 1992.

From the late 1960s until his death in 1975, Yolanda Sonnabend collaborated with the biologist and embryologist C.H. Waddington. She was employed as his research assistant on various projects, and produced the artwork for his book 'Tools for Thought: how to understand and apply the latest scientific techniques of problem solving', which was intended to be a popular guide to new ways of perceiving and understanding the world's scientific, political and ecological problems. Sonnabend's stark and imaginative pen and ink drawings formed the perfect complement to Waddington's ideas, incorporating triangles, graphs, arrows and bird heads, although unfortunately many of her original designs did not make it into the final book, which was finally published two years after Waddington's death.

John Webster Lowson Spence was born in Smyrna (now Izmir, Turkey) in 1871, the son of a Church of Scotland missionary, the Rev David Brown Spence, who later moved to Constantinople. The younger Spence went to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating in 1898. After an earlier association with Wilhelm Roentgen (discoverer of X-rays, 1895), radiology became his speciality, first as an assistant in the new electrical department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then, from 1907, as head of the electrical and radiological department of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children where he remained for 22 years. Because of the lack of protection available in these early years of working with X-rays - and indeed lack of understanding of the damage that they could do - Spence soon showed signs of illness and damage and between 1910 and 1916 he had to undergo amputations. In 1922 he was awarded a bronze medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund with an annuity of £130 in recognition of his work in radiology. A few years after his death his name was inscribed on a memorial erected in the garden of St. George's Hospital in Hamburg (April 1936) by the German Roentgen Society to honour those X-ray pioneers who had sacrificed their health or their lives in the interests of their work. John Webster Lowson Spence died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1930, aged only 58.

Letter :: Turnbull, Anne G
|
Thomson compares the American high school system to the English secondary school system. He argues that there is much to be learned from the American system which, as a result of offering a free education up to 18 for all who wish it and are able, relies on a more varied curriculum which incorporates social and vocational education alongside more academic subjects such as English, Mathematics, classics and science. Thomson reasons that more provision should be made in England for average students who wish to learn vocational subjects. He makes a case for a school model similar to that of America. However, rather than having students of different ability in the same schools, which he argues lowers existing standards, he proposes new schools should be created for the purpose of teaching more social and vocational subjects as in America He also discusses the finance of education – both secondary schools and universities – in America, with particular reference to variation between States; the fact of compulsory military training at some free State universities and private schools; and the American technique of "work-study-play" or platoon schools, in which children change activity and location throughout the school day.

Alec Cheyne was born on 1 June 1924 in Errol in Perthshire, son of the Reverend Alexander Cheyne, United Free Church Minister of Errol, and Catherine Anna Campbell. His sister Mona was born in 1925 and brother George in 1927. He was educated at Kirkcaldy High School before going on to Edinburgh University where he graduated with first class honours in history in 1946. Also in 1946 Alec became an instructor at the Army School of Education following basic training with the Black Watch.
Following two years of national service Alec Cheyne studied at Oriel College Oxford for another two years and graduated BLitt in 1950. That same year he was appointed to a lectureship in history at Glasgow and in 1953 he entered New College as a regular candidate for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. He graduated BD with distinction in Ecclesiastical History in 1956. Following his graduation from New College, Alec Cheyne was granted a post-graduate year on the continent, first at Tubingen to study German, then at Basel to study theology under Karl Bath and Oscar Cullman. He returned to Edinburgh in July of 1957, and from then until February 1958 he travelled around Scotland as a probationer filling preaching vacancies. In 1958 Alec Cheyne answered a call to the new lectureship in Church History at Edinburgh University and returned here in 1958 to begin years of dedication to teaching.
In 1964 Cheyne succeeded Professor Burleigh to the position of Professor of Ecclesiastical History and went on to create a four person department which came to play an integral role in the teaching of history throughout the University. Professor Cheyne also introduced both new courses and new styles of teaching, for example seminars in addition to the traditional lecture. Alec Cheyne served for several years as Chairman of the University History Board and was Principal of the Faculty of Divinity and New College from 1984 to 1986, the year of his retiral.
Professor Cheyne died on March 31st 2006.

Christabel Harriette Pankhurst was born in Manchester on 22 September 1880. She was the daughter of lawyer Dr. Richard Pankhurst and women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and sister of Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela Pankhurst. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War. Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst, DBE, died on 13 February 1958.

Thomson thanks Ledermann for his response to his previous letter, stating how neat his proofs are and discussing them at length. He refers to a paper of Aitken's published in the Edinburgh Mathematics Society, series 2, vol. 4, part II, and explores how the formula therein can assist them. The letter is unsigned, so appears to be incomplete.

Manuscript volume of pp.492, in neat hand on narrow folio paper with numerous additional blanks. Item is bound in contemporary half calf, gilt bands, lettered in gilt. The volume begins with a detailed 'Table 1st' and 'Table 2nd'. The 'Table 1st' details the age, occupation, symptoms, and state of the different physical functions (vital, natural, animal, and sexual). The 'Table 2nd' details the necessary information for the taking of daily reports, the effects of medicines, the state of former symptoms, any new symptoms, and the state of primitive functions. The 88 surgical reports follow the comprehensive brief of the tables, recording the name, symptoms, initial treatment and daily progress or decline of patients. One particular report records almost three months of treatment for Betty Campbell who 'suffered a most extensive burn over the back, breasts and neck and superior extremities' after her clothes had caught fire. She died 'in great agony' on 28 January 1827 'having been admitted on November 2nd, 1826'.

Thomson expresses his disappointment over the decision of the Faculty of Science not allowing Ledermann to submit his DSc. He encourages him to speak to staff at St Andrews and make a formal application, and tells him he will speak to both Edinburgh University and St Andrews University if this is unsuccessful. Thomson comments that C Spearman has written an Anti-Thomson article in the British Journal of Psychology, and tells him that The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability should be published very soon. He comments that Ledermann must have had an anxious time in the last few months, and enquires as to how his family are in Palestine.

Four letters of Isaac Forsyth, bookseller in ElginLetter sent by Isaac Forsyth to Patrick Duff, originally enclosing prospectus relating to a book by 'Dr Falconer of Forres', whom Forsyth describes as 'a gigantic geologist'. He is very probably talking of Hugh Falconer (1808-1865), a Scottish geologist, botanist and palaeontologist who studied the flora and fauna in India and Burma. Forsyth mentions the 'two hundred chests' Falconer brought back from India in 1842, and says that their contents 'would be worth a dash to London in a steamer even if [they] should pay twa shillings for a Finnan Haddock in passing thro' canny Aberdeen-aura' [area?]. Isaac Forsyth and Patrick were parts of a group of Elgin men who set up a Sciences museum in Elgin during the 1830s-1840s.Letter to Colonel Brades, relating to unsold tickets - and cash for tickets sold - at event to be held at Exeter Hall in the StrandLetter of 24th November 1851, offering thanks for sack of Swedish turnips deliveredLetter of 1857, relating to a book to be boundLetter of 1857 relating to plates in Elgin Cathedral

Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy hailed from the Kennedy family of Kilmarnock which included Thomas Kennedy c1796-1874, founder of Glenfield & Kennedy (producers of valves) and inventor of the world's first water meter. During the Second World War, Kennedy served with the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), 1942-1945. She was stationed at HMS Pembroke III, the WRNS training depot at Mill Hill in 1942, then at HMS Beaver, Hull, from 1942 to 1943, at HMS Drake, Devonport, in 1943, and then at HMS Pembroke III again and HMS Pembroke V, Bletchley Park, between 1943 and 1945. At Bletchley Park she was working with the team of allied codebreakers who were able to decrypt a vast number of messages that had been enciphered using the German's Enigma machine. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed 'Ultra' by the British, had been a substantial aid to the Allied war effort. In the 1960s and 1970s she was living in London, but by the early 1980s residing in Edinburgh and working at Edinburgh University Library. Kennedy served as an Elder at St. Cuthbert's Parish Church, Edinburgh, and lived in the Marchmont district of the city. She had been the inspiration behind the founding of the Rock Trust - a charity for homeless people. Marjorie Jean Oswald Kennedy died in November 2002 aged 87. In August the following year there was local press coverage of the large fortune of £1.5-million left in her will and which had been inherited from her family.

These notes relate to Beale's work on intragenic recombination among the antigen-determining genes in Paramecium. Beale constructed heterozygotes involving various combinations of different 'd' antigen alleles, passed them through autogamy and screened the progeny with sera capable of immobilising the parental types. Theoretically intragenic recombinants should have appeared, but the only novel types Beale got turned out to be 'nuls' - i.e. cells unable to express any antigen controlled by the locus corresponding to the original types used.

Helen Millar Lowe was born in Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, on 10 December 1897. She was the daughter of James Millar Lowe, a coal agent, and Margaret Lowe, who had married locally on 29 June 1892. She attended Berwickshire High School, in Duns.  Lowe worked with the firm of chartered accountants Chiene and Tait in Edinburgh for nine years, going to them first in 1919. After an Act was passed that allowed women to qualify as Chartered Accountants she indentured with Chiene and Tait, went straight through the examinations and was admitted as a Chartered Accountant in 1926. In the lead up to the CA examinations she took some classes in Accounting and Business Method and Mercantile Law at Edinburgh University. She was the third woman in Edinburgh to qualify as a Chartered Accountant, and according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) she was the second female member of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh, and the fourth woman chartered accountant in all of Scotland. While with Chiene and Tait she did practically all their income tax work and did a good deal of work in arranging investments and insurance.  In 1928 she began her own chartered accountancy business, the first woman in Edinburgh who had taken this step seriously. She conducted her business at 28 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and then from November 1930 at 44 Charlotte Square. During her career she instigated many projects in the service of elderly people, especially through the Edinburgh and Leith Old People's Welfare Council for which she was awarded an MBE in 1964. She had a lifelong interest in the medical profession, mounting a successful campaign in 1957 to ensure that the Bruntsfield Hospital for Women and the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital employed only qualified female medical staff. She was treasurer of both hospitals when they were handed to the NHS in 1947 and also maintained roles in other medical organisations such as the South Eastern Association of the Medical Women's Federation of which she was appointed Honorary Auditor in 1978. A second campaign to save the hospitals from closure in the 1980s was unsuccessful Helen Millar Lowe died on 6 November 1997 just five weeks from her 100th birthday. She left a substantial fortune (reported to have been circa £7m) which had been built on a portfolio of stocks and shares and a number of local properties.

Information on this volume has been largely based on the research of D. W. Taylor of the University of Otago. Key phrases identified by him are all present in the volume and pinpoint the lectures to 1774-1775.  Alexander Monro, secundus, younger son of Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767), was born in Edinburgh on 20 May 1733. He was educated at Mr. Mundell's School in the city, and in 1752 he entered Edinburgh University to pursue medical studies. From 1753, he occasionally lectured for his father who was Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, and in July 1755 he became Joint Professor with his father. In October 1755 he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the subject of his dissertation being De Testibus et Semine in variis Animalibus . After graduating he went to London to attend William Hunter's lectures, then visited Paris, Leyden, and Berlin. In 1758 he succeeded his father as Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh University and the following year he was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He became President of that body in 1779. His works included Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system  (1783), Structure and physiology of fishes explained and compared with those of man and other animals  (1785), Bursae Mucosae  (1788), and The brain, the eye, and the ear  (1797). Between 1798 to 1808, Monro shared the Professorship with his son, Alexander Monro, tertius (1773-1859). Monro died on his estate at Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, on 2 October 1817.

At E87.71 there is a letter of Chalmers written at the 'Office for Trade, Whitehall' on 21 July 1788, to the sister of 'the late Mr. Richardson of Kensington' (William Richardson). The letter refers to his objective of doing 'justice to the memory of' Richardson, and goes on to mention the 'essay on the causes of the decline of Foreign trade, which I think was written by Mr. Richardson'. In the letter he says that the essay 'is very generally attributed to Sir Matthew Decker'. He hopes though that he might be informed 'of some facts and circumstances which would enable' him to settle the 'doubtful point in favour' of the woman's brother. He asks if she knows of any papers remaining 'which prove that Mr. Richardson wrote this essay, or anything else'. Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679-1749) was an English merchant and writer on trade, an MP, and director of the East India Company.

William McLaren (1923–1987) was born in Ferniegair, Hamilton, but grew up in Cardenden, Fife, Scotland with a crippling handicap that affected his feet. He attended Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, before going to college in Edinburgh. In 1944 he earned his Diploma and the Highly Commended Post Diploma from Edinburgh College of Art. After graduation and with a bursary from the Andrew Grant Fund he left Scotland and visited Italy and France. Throughout his life he remained a francophile and was fluent in French. McLaren earned a living as a commercial illustrator working for such titles as The Radio Times and The Listener. He is noted for illustrating the popular Beverley Nichols gardening books. He also painted murals at Wemyss Castle, St Adrian's Church in West Wemyss, Hopetoun House, Hawthornden Castle and Tyninghame House. He also produced a portfolio of work around Edmund Spenser's Prothalamion.  Edmund Spenser (c. 1552 – 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene (1590-1596), an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognised as one of the premier craftsmen of Modern English verse in its infancy, and one of the greatest poets in the English language. Following The Faerie Queene Spenser released Prothalamion, a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke.

Robert Sutherland W.S. was born in 1926. After some years in Stornoway and then in Essex, his family returned to Edinburgh and he spent his last few school years at the city's George Watson's College. He served in the Indian Army (1944-1947) towards the end of the Second World War. He had been a lieutenant in the Assam Regiment. In 1951 Sutherland graduated with the degree of MA (Hons) in Economic Science, and then in 1953 with the degree of LL.B., both from Edinburgh University. From 1955 to 1973 he was a principal partner in the law firm Stuart and Stuart W.S. in Edinburgh, though after his graduation he also tutored in Conveyancing in Edinburgh University for several years. In 1972, he became a Lecturer, and subsequently Senior Lecturer, in Private Law at Glasgow University, retiring in 1990. Among his academic interests he was, for a time, a member of council of the Stair Society, an external examiner in Legal History at Edinburgh University, and a member of council of the Geological Society of Edinburgh. He also served as a member of the Business Committee of the General Council of Edinburgh University and of some of its sub-committees. For some years, Sutherland held lay office in the Episcopal Church in Scotland and was variously a member of the Diocesan Council and the Representative Church Council and some other Committees and Boards. For several years he was a member of the Law Reform Committee of the Law Society of Scotland. He is an honorary member of the Scottish Economic Society. In addition to a wide general experience as a practitioner for more than twenty years, he is an Honorary Sheriff of Tayside, Central and Fife and was for a number of years a Chairman of Social Security Tribunals in Glasgow, and Depute Chairman of central Lands Valuation Appeals Panel. Until his retirement Sutherland was a Solicitor and remains a Writer to the Signet and a Notary Public. He is a Fellow of the Edinburgh Geological Society and of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and a member of the Stair Society and the Scottish Record Society. He has maintained a strong interest in Scandinavian, particularly Norwegian, language and literature.

The letter from H. G. A. (Harry Gidney Aldis) is dated 2 February 1913, Candlemas day, on paper embossed with Grennan, Grantchester Meadows, Cambridge. It is written to 'My dear Johnston' . The letter refers to no further word 'heard from the Astronomer Royal about the incunabula which he is so yearning to send to Cambridge for possible identification'. The letter also talks about illness in the library and about how work offers 'much arrears to mop up before we can venture to start on fifteeners' (incunabula). It goes on to mention how there 'is no photograph or other illustration of the Laing MS of the Philobiblon that I know of' . Aldis has also enclosed 'a rubbing of the binding [...] It is a XVth cent manuscript and the binding is alike on both sides. The letter offers an archival history of the manuscript 'as related by E.G.D.' (possibly E. Gordon Duff). Apparently it had been 'bought by Laing (through Rev. Wm Stevens) in 1839 from J. L. C. Jacob of Rotterdam for 42 francs'. The letter was placed inside a copy of Notices of David Laing : to which is added a chronological list of the various publications which were issued under his editorial superintendence from the year M.DCCC.XV. to the year M.DCCC.LXVIII inclusive, by Thomas George Stevenson, 1878, along with a Letter from Edward Gordon Duff (1863-1924) to Mr. Johnston which is now at E2010.34. The letter is accompanied by the rubbing mentioned above.

This volume of notes is based on Monro's surgical lectures at Edinburgh Medical School, 1774-1775. The manuscript lectures are sub-headed Lectures 1-13 and are in two distinct hands - the first two lectures in one, and the rest in another. The paper is watermarked with a crown and the initials GR, undated, but this L.V.Gerrevink paper commonly used throughout much of the 18th century. Both hands are clear and legible, with just a few corrections, and occasional additions written on the verso of some leaves. The volume is bound in mottled calf with gilt banded spine, unlettered.

In the lecture, Thomson outlines his utilitarian educational creed, which involves the greatest happiness of the greatest number. He makes a moral and ethical case for this, and contrasts and balances it with the concept of truth, as well as the needs of the individual, particularly the cultivation and encouragement of genius and talent.  Thomson relates this creed back to educational systems and problems, summarising the sometimes conflicting demands each section of the community has of education: school pupils, parents, employers, communities, and government. He touches on the importance of literacy and the attitudes of the ruling classes to its rise, as well as the issue of propaganda in schools.

Some of these notes refer to Beale's 'metagon' theory, which postulated that certain genes might liberate in the cytoplasm of Paramecia invisible entities called 'metagons' which control the ability of the cell to permit growth of visible endosymbiotic 'mu' (mate-killer) particles. Beale's key paper about the metagon was published in collaboration with Ian Gibson in 1962. Ultimately, however, it had to be abandoned, because Beale was unable to discover any consistent results from later experiments. 'Kappa' and 'Lambda' refer to certain symbionts of Paramecium.

Bristo Street ran diagonally across Charles Street Car Park from "Bristo Square" (a new development, c1980) to the north end of Chapel Street; it was a main road, now replaced by the new Potterrow. The drysalter's shop on the left was in existence until the demolition of the street c. 1970 (?). "Parker's Corner" on the right shows (c. 1910?) the building as it was before the opening of the drapper's shop with mock Tudor facings, demolished about the same time.

This collection item is often described as a death-mask. It is not a death-mask, rather it is a life-mask made from a mould taken from the living face of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The a German writer, pictorial artist, biologist, theoretical physicist, and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt-am-Main, Hessen, Germany. His work spanned the fields of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, and science. Goethe was one of the key figures of German literature and the movement of Weimar Classicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His influential ideas on plant and animal morphology and homology were extended and developed by 19th century naturalists including Charles Darwin. In politics Goethe was conservative and he served as a Privy Councillor of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar. Goethe's influence spread across Europe, and for the next century his works were a major source of inspiration in music, drama, poetry and philosophy. Goethe's works included: Faust which has been called the greatest long poem of modern European literature; Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and The Sorrows of Young Werther. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe died in Weimar on 22 March 1832. Carl Gottlieb Weisser (also Gottlob Weiser) was born in Berlin on 21 August 1779. He took a life-mask of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe possibly on 13 October 1807 for the phrenologist F. J. Gall, who visited Goethe at Weimar. Carl Gottlieb Weisser died in Weimar on 2 April 1815.

Furniture historian Clive Wainwright was born on 2 April 1942 in Langport, Somerset, in England. He was educated at Huish's Grammar School, Taunton, and then he joined the plastics research division of ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in Welwyn Garden City.  Wainwright continued his education taking evening classes in art history, and then joined the staff of the Victoria and Albert Museum, first as an assistant in the National Art Library and then on the staff of the Keeper of Woodwork. Knowledge that he built up on the Victorian scene was translated to a doctoral thesis, a small collection of his own, and a large library of Victorian books. His principal interest had been Pugin and he came to play a key role in the refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster. In 1988, he was appointed Assistant Keeper in the department of Furniture and Interior Design, adn in 1989 he published his thesis The romantic interior: the British collector at home, 1750-1850. His other works included Furniture in the Palace of Westminster (1974), jointly with John Hardy, and High Victorian design (1974), collaborating with Simon Jervis. Wainwright was elected to the Society of Antiquaries of London on 6 December 1973, and was a member of its Council in 1980. Clive Wainwright, PhD. died on 2 July 1999.

The lecture comprises of Thomson's advice to new and inexperienced lecturers, and covers topics such as the audibility and clarity of the lecturer; the importance of the lecturer believing in what they are saying; the importance of engaging with the audience; effective use of blackboards, notes, diagrams, examples and models; and the use of humour. Thomson's humour is clear throughout. The advice he offers is actually very unusual for this time – Lawn et all describe it as an innovative step in university teaching, probably about 15 years before the subject began to take hold with the expansion of the universities and the publication of the hale report.

A copy from perhaps 1763 of the manuscript account of the escape of Archibald Bower (1686-1766), a Scottish historian, from the Inquisition, 'Taken from his own mouth, by a Lady'. Archibald Bower was born at or near Dundee in 1685-1686. He was educated at the Scots College, Douai, which had been established in 1594 for the training of Scottish Roman Catholic exiles. Afterwards he went to Rome, and was admitted into the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1706. Bower then spent time in Fano, Arezzo, Florence, Macerata, and Perugia. The reasons for his flight from Perugia in 1726 are varied. Some say that he had been caught with a nun, but Bower himself said that it was because of the terrible proceedings of the Court of the Inquisition at Macerata, in which he said that he was counsellor or judge. He later returned to the Church of England. His own manuscript account of his escape had circulated in a number of versions during the eighteenth century. Archibald Bower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard.

William Stewart Watson was born in 1800 and died in Edinburgh in 1870. Watson is said to have practised for some years in America, but he was in Rome in 1840 and in London between 1843 and 1847, after which he settled in Edinburgh where he remained for the rest of his life. The artist's favourite subjects were portraits and history paintings. In addition to painting, Stewart Watson often used other techniques and materials such as ink, watercolour, chalk and charcoal. He is also known as a miniature painter. His pictures Joseph Grant, WS, Seated at a Desk , George Gordon, 6th Lord Byron (1823), Don Quixote Tilting at a Windmill  (before 1832), Holyrood Dairy, Edinburgh (c. 1840), and The Inauguration of Robert Burns as Poet Laureate of the Lodge (1846) are in the Signet Library, Edinburgh City Art Collection, and the National Galleries of Scotland.

Within this collection of 65 Scottish charters and documents in Early Scots and Latin, there is a small part which was probably the remnant of an archive of the Burgesses of Perth. This remnant of fifteenth century material is said to have been held together since 1911 at least, when they were leant by J. A. Beattie to the 1911 Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry in the Palace of History (Kelvingrove Park), Glasgow. The items in question are noted below (in Scope and Content, nos: 1-3), and are: a charter between Abbot Alexander of Scone and Lady Catherine Paxton; a grant of land from Robert Logy (perhaps Logie), Burgess of Perth; and, a charter from Alexander Seres (perhaps Ceres), Burgess of Perth, to John Mirtone, Canon of Dunkeld.It is through the study of legal documents like these that our knowledge of Early Scots can be greatly added to, for it has been said that the literary (as opposed to the legal) record of the Scots language was 'very late in beginning'. Indeed with the 'exception of one or two fragments of verse, there is nothing that can be definitely set down as earlier than the Bruce of John Barbour' in or around 1375. If literature had been the only source open for researchers, there would have been almost no material available for the study of Scots prior to 1375 (see W.A. Craigie, 'The earliest records of the Scottish tongue', Scottish Historical Review. Vol.22, No.85. October 1924, pp.61-67). The legal documents that form this collection were created within three decades of that early work of literature.

Hamish Henderson, the folklorist, poet, soldier, socialist, songwriter, CND peace campaigner and anti-apartheid activist, was born in Blairgowrie on 11 November 1919. He was raised by his Gaelic-speaking mother and his Episcopalian maternal grandmother, spending his early childhood in Blairgowrie and Glenshee. Orphaned at the age of thirteen, Henderson obtained scholarships first to Dulwich College and then to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. Having a gift for languages he was commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. He served with the Eighth Army - in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. This provided him with the opportunity to note and to remember moments that would later become poems and series of poems, such as Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica, and the song The 51st (Highland) Division's Farewell to Sicily. After the war, he took various teaching engagements, including one at a German high school teachers' summer school in Bad Godesberg, and another working with German prisoners of war in Comrie, Perthshire. Between 1948 and 1949 he was also a district secretary for the Workers' Educational Association. At the same time he was producing a great deal of literary and political criticism, poetry, and songs. In his work, Henderson swung between English and Scots, like Burns before him, writing only rarely in Gaelic. In 1951 Henderson was appointed a lecturer and research fellow at Edinburgh University's School of Scottish Studies. His work there as a folk-song collector formed the foundation of the Scottish folk revival. Henderson's influence travelled far wider than Scotland. He fed songs, disquisition, and polemic into the international folk scene. He took up political argument through his poems and songs, on issues to do with land ownership and access, anti-Polaris missile, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Among Henderson's other work are: Ballads of World War II (1947), The Ballad of the Men of Knoydart, Freedom Come-All-Ye (1960), and Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci (1974, 1988, 1996). Hamish Henderson died in Edinburgh in a nursing home, after a stroke, on 8 March 2002. Michael Sharp was educated at universities in Britain and the United States. His Ph.D is from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professor Sharp has taught in Scotland, Greece, Portugal, Nigeria, and at the universities of Binghamton, Harvard, and Wisconsin. He has been a Teaching Fellow in the International School of Theory in the Humanities at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Trained as a Romanticist and in the Literature and Ideas of the nineteenth century, Michael Sharp teaches in the University of Puerto Rico's Department of English where he is active in both the English M.A. and Caribbean PhD programs. His research focuses on the poetry of Anglophone Africa and the Caribbean diaspora. Michael Sharp's poetry has been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Sharp, Michael: "War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson: London Magazine, April/May, 1983  Sharp's publications include War pipes in Africa: the elegies of Hamish Henderson which appeared in the 'London magazine', April/May, 1983.

Charles Hedges was born in either 1649 or 1650. he was educated at Magdalen, Oxford, where he took a B.A. in 1670, an M.A. in 1673, and a D.C.L in 1675. In his last year of study he was admitted to the Society of Advocates, and by 1686 he was Chancellor and Vicar-General of the Diocese of Rochester. In 1689 he was created Master of the Faculties and Judge of the Admiralty Court. Hedges was also knighted on 4 June 1689. From 1698 he contested various constituencies for a seat in Parliament including Orford in Suffolk, Dover, Calne and Malmesbury, West Looe, and East Looe. In 1700 he became a Secretary of State and Privy Councillor with the help of the Earl of Rochester (1641-1711). For some time Sir Charles Hedges resided at Richmond Green, but in 1700 he bought an estate in Compton Bassett, near Calne in Wiltshire. Hedges died on 10 June 1714. The background to the collection item, from Hedges as Secretary of State, to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is the Aliens Act of 1705 which stated that, from Christmas Day 1705 until the Scottish Parliament passed an Act settling the Scottish Crown upon the successor to the English Crown, every Scot should be considered an alien. At the time that the letter was written (November 1706) the Viceroy (Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland was James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde KG, KT (1665–1745), Irish statesman and soldier. The Duke of Ormonde had succeeded the Earl of Rochester to the post in 1703, and was Viceroy until 1707.

Margaret Winifred Bartholomew was born on 21 August 1885 at Duntarvie, West Lothian, just over a dozen miles west of Edinburgh. She was the third of the five children of John and Agnes Bartholomew. Her father was a farmer and her mother a musician. She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies College between 1895 and 1903, and then she studied at the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, 1903-1908, graduating with the degrees of M.B. and Ch.B. from Edinburgh University, 1908. Her aunt, Dr. Isabella Mears, a missionary in China, was one of the first ten women to become a doctor in Britain. From 1908, and for a year, Bartholomew worked as an Assistant in General Practice, and then in 1909 she gained a post as a Medical Missionary in the Womens Hospital, Nagpur, India where she carried out surgical work and midwifery. In 1914, she returned to Scotland, and on the outbreak of war took over her brother's medical practice near Edinburgh. In 1915 however, in November, she had returned to India, and in Bombay married Frank Rushworth who was at that time a Captain in the 7th Rajputs, an Indian Regiment stationed in the North West Frontier. By the end of the year though, Rushforth had been sent to Mesopotamia. In 1916, Winifred was working in the Mission Hospital, Jalna, in central India, doing surgical work and inoculations against bubonic plague and cholera. In 1917, her husband returned to India to a government post in Simla, and she did surgical work in a womens hospital there. In 1920 they moved to Calcutta, where Frank worked in business and Winifred was a volunteer worker organising infant welfare work and started child guidance with mothers groups. For this work, Rushforth received the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal (Emperor of India Medal). In 1929, in London, she underwent training at the Tavistock Clinic beginning a personal analysis and carrying out analytic treatment of patients. By 1931, the Depression had ended her husband's career in Calcutta and so the family settled in Edinburgh where he worked as Registrar at the Edinburgh College of Art. Rushforth continued with personal analysis and in 1933 began work as an analytical psycho-therapist in private practice in Edinburgh - at this time, very much pioneer work in Scotland. In 1939, just as the War started, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was joined by Dr. Elspeth Macleod - a child therapist - and several of her own patients who had teaching and other qualifications, and opened a small clinic with the support of a Presbyterian congregation. This was the Davidson Clinic. Her confidence in analytic psycho-therapy was strengthened by the arrival in Scotland of Jewish refugee psychiatrists from Germany, and one of them, Dr. William Kraemer, joined her in 1941 and they worked together for sixteen years establishing the Davidson Clinic. During the wartime years, and after, the Clinic flourished, and as other doctors and clinicians associated themselves with it, psycho-therapists were able to be trained. As far as patients were concerned - and as concerned the analytical work - at one time as many as 100 patients were being treated daily. Then, with the passing of the Mental Health Act (1959), and the re-organisation of the mental hospitals across the UK, the treatment of neurosis and psycho-therapy was taken over by the State and new era of treatment began using barbiturate drugs and tranquillisers. Unable to offer comparable salaries to those offered by the National Health Service (NHS) it became impossible to recruit psychiatric staff, and so the Davidson Clinic was not able to survive. From its inception in 1939 and until 1965, Dr. Winifred Rushforth was the Honorary Medical Director of the Davidson Clinic. On the death of her successor, she returned to the Clinic to wind up its affairs. Then, in 1967, Rushforth was awarded the OBE in recognition for her work. From 1965 until her death she continued her private practice in psycho-therapy working both with individual patients and also with Dream-Growth groups. In addition, Easter and Summer schools were held after 1965 and out of these the Sempervivum Trust emerged. Rushforth also provided inspiration to the work of the Salisbury Centre, Edinburgh (1973), and of Wellspring, Edinburgh (1978). In 1981, at the age of ninety-five, she published Something is happening: spiritual awareness and depth psychology in the new age. It was first published in London by the Turnstone Press. Another work was Ten decades of happenings (1984), which was an autobiography. After her death, Life's Currency: Time, Money and Energy: An Anthology of Shorter Writings (1986) was published. Dr. Winifred Rushforth died at her home in Edinburgh on 29 August 1983. Sir Laurens van der Post attended Dr Rushforth's Memorial Service in Old St Paul's Church, Edinburgh, as Prince Charles's representative. Earlier that year, the Prince and Princess of Wales had visited her in her home.

Thomson discusses how intelligence is distributed between the various social or occupational levels of society. He explains the normal distribution of intelligence within the population, drawing parallels with the distribution of height.  Thomson refers to inquiries carried out by him in Northumberland in 1922, and inquiries carried out in the Isle of Wight in 1924, which demonstrated that individual differences outweigh social differences, and supported the notion that heredity plays more part than environment in determining intelligence. He addresses the problem of the differential birth rate, arguing that the best defence against this is mankind's differences, and these should be encouraged by equality in education, allowing secondary schools to be a mixture of abilities and talents opposed to segregation of intelligence.

prigioniera ho calma in pena by Georg Frideric Handel

The Scottish painter David Wilkie was born on 18 November 1785 at Cults, Fife. He went to school locally at at Pitlessie, and at Kettle, Fife. While at school he was able to exercise a drawing ability which was obvious at an early age. When he was fourteen, in 1799, he set off to Edinburgh, to the Trustee's Academy of Design in St. James's Square. While there he made progress in painting portraits and miniatures. In 1804 he returned to Cults and there he produced a painting of the Pitlessie Fair which made him very well-known. After a brief stay in Aberdeen, Wilkie sailed for London in May 1805 where he continued his studies. His painting of The Village Politicians brought him more attention and, of course, new commissions. On the death of his father in 1812, his mother and sister came to London to join him, and from 1812 the family lived in Kensington, initially at Lower Philimore Place. Works by Wilkie include: The Reading of the will; The Highland family; Princess Doria washing Pilgrims' feet; Guerilla Council of War; Preaching of Knox before the Lords of the Congregation, 10 June 1559; The Duke of Wellington writing a despatch; and Napoleon and the Pope in Conference at Fontainebleau. David Wilkie was knighted in June 1836. In 1840, he travelled to Istanbul (then called Constantinople) where he painted Abdul Medjid, the young Sultan, and then went on to Jerusalem in 1841. That year he set off home again reaching Alexandria on 26 April 1841, and there he painted Pacha Mehemet Ali. A month later he sailed again, but after departing from Gibraltar on 1 June 1841, he died. On account of the quarantine regulations of the period, Sir David Wilkie was buried at sea at latitude 36 degrees 20' north and 6 degrees 42' west.

The lecture was delivered to a wide audience, and is designed to be understood by non-statisticians, and non-educators. In it, Thomson explores the uses and limitations of statistics in both education and psychology, illustrating his points with examples of how an educator might effectively predict a child's performance and offer vocational guidance appropriate to their ability and intelligence.  Thomson discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample and the effect sampling bias has on investigations of causation, and highlights some of the difficulties in obtaining a sample and how these might be overcome. He also touches upon the use of statistics to inform the raising of the school age, and explores the use of statistical methods in collating examination marks to provide indicators of intelligence and predictors of future career success. He highlights the value in using statistical techniques, particularly the concept of distribution, to enhance teachers' ratings of pupils' ability and to enable direct comparison across age groups. He describes intelligence tests as a less subjective indication of future career and performance, while also discussing the phenomenon that an individual's test results in all tests, whether intelligence, dexterity, or vocational fitness, tend to be positively correlated.

Includes lectures delivered by Thomson largely concerning education and intelligence testing. Most of these lectures have been delivered to mixed and public audiences, and are subsequently decipherable to those with no previous knowledge of the topics covered. Thomson has often underlined or circled words or phrases throughout in red pencil in order to act as an aide memoir, and several lectures have a handwritten covering sheet which notes Thomson's main points.

Peter McIntyre was born in the 1920s and was raised in Dunbar, East Lothian, where he attended Dunbar Secondary School. He studied at Edinburgh University, entering in 1937. The Second World War however intervened and he served with the Army Educational Corps in India reaching the rank of Warrant Officer First Class. McIntyre returned to Edinburgh in 1946 to resume his studies, and he was awarded a First Class Honours degree (MA) in History in July 1948 (although the University Calendar records the award as 1948, the 'University of Edinburgh Journal' records the MA as 1940 as does the Library's card index file). After graduation he joined the staff of W. and R. Chambers, printers and publishers, becoming an editor and indexer. In 1954 he moved to the editorial staff of the University Press in Edinburgh. There, among many tasks, he collaborated with Professor D. Talbot Rice, writing the biographies for the work The university portraits (1957). McIntyre was also well known as Clerk to the University Senate, and later on as Academic Secretary, though illness meant he had to leave the latter post in 1966. He continued work with Edinburgh University however as Editor of the University Calendar and other University publications. McIntyre's publications included: a pamphlet entitled The Robes about University of Edinburgh formal robes for the Principal, Chancellor and Rector; a pamphlet on The Old College; a chapter entitled The Franchise Courts for the work Introduction to Scottish Legal History; and, A University within a city...a brief history of the University for the University of Edinburgh Bulletin, Vol.13. No.7. 4 February 1977. At the time of his death he was, according to his daughter, working on a pamphlet on The Old College Statuette (of Sir Cowasji Jehangir). Outside of his work with Edinburgh University he maintained a life long interest in Scottish history. Peter McIntyre died in London on 14 June 1982. His funeral was held at St. Anne's, Dunbar, East Lothian.

For the Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd., Atlantic passenger carrying would last barely four decades from 1921. In the 1960s when air travel and cargo containerisation started to compete with North Atlantic shipping companies, passenger ships were gradually sold and new container and bulk cargo vessels built. The firm moved with the times.  The 'Empress of Britain' of the 1950 and 1960s was the third Canadian Pacific ship of that name. Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering of Glasgow and the sister ship of the 'Empress of England' which came into service a year after the 'Empress of Britain', the 25,526 ton ship was launched by Queen Elizabeth II at Govan on 22 June 1955. The ship was said to be the first of the North Atlantic liners to be completely air-conditioned. The ship's maiden voyage began on 20 April 1956 from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal, the company's summer route. The 'Empress of Britain' served only seven years on the route and its final Liverpool trip began on 3 September 1963.  Verna Isaac, of Wichita, Kansas, sailed on the 'Empress of Britain' (Tourist Class) on Tuesday 22 August 1961 westbound across the Atlantic from Liverpool to Montreal where it arrived on 29 August. The sailing was via Greenock and Quebec.

The copy of the letter is dated 1 April 1882 below the statement that it 'is an exact copy of the copy of the original letter as made by D. Lewis', 1 December 1859.  The original letter was written in London 20 December 1766 by Dr. Benjamin Franklin and was addressed to Dr. Benjamin Rush and Dr. Jonathan Potts. It refers to letters of introduction to several of Franklin's friends in Edinburgh. At the same time he states that 'you will be your own best frtiends if you apply diligently to your studies, refraining from all idle useless amusements'. The letter continues in this vein and then talks of the 'great advantages in going to study at Edinburgh at this time, where there happens to be collected a set of truly great men'.

Thomson explores his discovery regarding correlation co-efficients, or what he refers to as profile correlations, in a doubly centred matrix in relation to Thurstone's centroid process.  He also refers to Ledermann's assertion regarding the approach of a powered matrix to rank one as the power rises, stating that he disagrees, and referring to the work of Burt. Also includes a post script which continues the discussion, referring to Thurstone's repetitive process, as well as containing a transcript of a letter written by M S Bartlett to Nature regarding a letter of Thomson's.

Collection of recordings (78rpm) of a lecture given by Sir Godfrey Thomson in 1950
|
The collection is composed of an imposing photograph of John A. W. Dollar, circa 1904-1905, in his presidential robes - President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons - and a bill with engraved bill-head of the Dollar veterinary practice on New Bond Street, London, with a fine engraved bill-head, a rare survival. The portrait was taken by the firm Elliott and Fry, 55 Baker Street, London W, and is numbered in pencil as No.206440D. The bill with engraved bill-head is dated in ink, 1901. It is the account between January 1901 and December 1901 with J. E. Taylor esq., Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and includes interesting information about veterinary costs in the early months of the 20th century - e.g. a 'nailing' presumably for a horse-shoe costing one shilling (January 16), four shoes for six shillings (April 1), and attendance, advice and a bottle of lotion for eight shillings and sixpence (June 13).

Royalties earned from Moray House Test sales were transferred into a research fund established by Thomson with the aim of supporting educational research. The fund was later registered as the Godfrey Thomson Research fund. The trust was formally established in 1940, when a Deed of Trust was drawn up between Thomson and the University. The fund was later administered by trustees, with the Professor of Education as Chairman and the Principal of Moray House College of Education as Vice-Chairman.  Additionally, the fund earned income from fees paid by county Education Committees for the analysing, collating and assessing of Moray House Test results.

Writer and reviewer John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, 6 August 1889. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and Brasenose College, Oxford. His literary career began in 1911 and his last book was publishe din 1957. Murry promoted the work of his wife, Katherine Mansfield, after her death in 1923, and his friendship with D. H. Lawrence inspired an autobiography of the great novelist. In the 1920s, Murry's interests shifted from literature to religious philosophy, and in the 1930s he converted to Marxism and then moved politically towards pacifism. His writing of the period reflected these shifts in interest. John Middleton Murry died 12 March 1957.  In the 1930s a dispute had arisen between John Middleton Murry and Catherine Carswell (1879-1946). She had attempted to answer Murry's work on D. H. Lawrence through a work of her own but publishers Chatto & Windus had withdrawn her book because of threats of legal action from Murry. Martin Secker had reissued a revised version in 1932. The letter here refers to this dispute.

The collection is composed of: 1 x letter from Professor George Chrystal to the Rt. Hon. The Prime Minister [Herbert Henry Asquith, 1908-1916] from 5 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, 12 June 1911. The letter, in effect turns down the honour of a knighthood 'on the occasion of His Majesty's approaching Coronation'. He was, in the first place, 'at this moment suffering from the effects of severe illness' and it would be several months before he could 'appear in London or take part in any public ceremonial', and in the second place, as a 60-year old widower with a family 'the greater part of which is still dependent' on him, he was 'therefore in no condition to support the social distinction of knighthood'. 9 x photographs of Chrystal and members of his family, being:    
      1 x photograph of William Chrystal, Professor Chrystal's father
      1 x portrait photograph, mounted on card, of the wife of Professor Chrystal

In 1938, R. Macgregor M.R.C.V.S. was working in the Veterinary Office, Raub, Pahang, in what was then the Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). Pahang is on the Malayan Peninsula, and agriculture is the main economic activity in Raub today, with fruit growing topping this - principally the cultivation of durians. Most is transported to other cities, especially Kuala Lumpur. Besides fruit, rubber tapping is also carried on. In the 1930s, Macgregor had been writing on the local domestic buffalo - animals which were domesticated essentially for use on uncared for pasture. The buffalo were of two distinct species, or types, one for use on dry ground and the other for use in swamps.

Thomson suggests Ledermann's new address means he has now found a house, and wishes he and his parents happiness. He asks him to send on the Psychometrika offprints. He refers Ledermann to two papers by E B Wilson and Jane Worcester respectively in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in particular drawing his attention to their use of a Thurstone formula, and suggests Ledermann might want to pursue the matter further. He asks Ledermann if he ever manages to get to Edinburgh, and suggests he might help him get a permit if necessary.  Also includes a page of incomplete notes regarding intelligence tests with reference to the Minnesota book and Hotelling's most predictable criterion.

Mary Ringsleben was an original signatory of the Committee of 100, which was founded on the initiative of Ralph Schoenman and Bertrand Russell in October 1960. This Committee called for a mass movement of civil disobedience against British government policy on nuclear weapons. Its members saw a need for more radical methods than those used by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, especially following the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1959 general election Based in Leeds, she was an organiser of the Northern Direct Action Committee. Ringsleben was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from Aberdeen University in 1956 for her work on Gavin Douglas - a Scottish bishop, makar and translator. She had been in contact with Scottish writer and poet Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve) about it, and he had lauded her work.

Henri V, the legitimist King of France from the abdication of Charles X in 1830 until his death in 1883, went into exile when Louis-Philippe was proclaimed king in August 1830. He established his court at Holyrood in Edinburgh, and a number of publications are associated with his time here. This is a curious collection of anonymous letters, apparently from a member of the refugee court, on a political theme. The provenance is unclear, but there is a loose note stating 'Pour mes pauvres petites filles de France' signed 'Louise' - and hopefully further research will identify her.

This manuscript diary begins on 18 February and ends 31 December 1848, though there is no extended entry for Sunday 31 December.  The diary describes a variety of events, often rural, and including a visit to Scotland: 18 February, 'the hounds in Pasture woods did not find a fox till the afternoon'; 1 March, 'had a telegraph sight put to my rifle'; 7/8 March, 'mobs of young miscreants still doing damage to the shop windows - good for glaziers and no one else; 1 April, 'Chartists aided by some French Republicans and other disaffected rascals are concocting row after the manner of the rest of Europe'; and, in Edinburgh, 10 September, 'Went to the English Church at the West end of Princes Street [...] there was plate at the door into which one is expected to put coppers after the Scottish fashion'.

These notes were most probably made when Beale was working in Indiana University, Bloomington, in Tracy Sonneborn's laboratory. At this time Beale was studying the change from serotype D to serotype B of stock 51 (variant 4). The cells were treated with an immunising and potentially lethal solution containing anti-D antibodies, which lead to the cells becoming 'resistant' to the immunising action. Tracy Sonneborn had previously shown that the 'sensitive' and 'resistant' types of cell were 'hereditary'. Beale demonstrated that this change involved a replacement of the initial antigen (D) by another one (B) which could take place in every cell which was treated, and that for an intermediate period, both antigens could be detected in a single cell. Beale published a paper on the subject in 1948 entitled 'The process of transformation of antigenic type in Paramecium' which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA (34, 418-423).

Thomson tells Ledermann how pleased he is that he is that Ledermann is going to follow up his [Thomson's] paper for the British Journal of Psychology, and asks him to include material regarding multivariate selection.  He talks about the various reading he has undertaken, referring to work by Bocher, Hotelling, and Turnbull; and discusses the connection between the correlation of orthogonal vectors produced by selection in the population, and the correlation of orthogonal vectors produced by estimating them from insufficient equations.

John Baillie served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1943-1944. The Church and Nation Committee was set up in 1919, by the Church of Scotland, to review its relationship to the national life of the country. It set up the more specific Commission for the Interpretation of God's Will in the Present Crisis at the General Assembly of 1940. Its role was, 'to seek reverently to guide the Church in the interpretation of the Holy Will and Purpose of God in present-day events, and to examine how the testimony of the Church to the Gospel may become more effective in our own land, overseas and in the international order'.

James Robertson was born in the parish of Cromarty in 1714. He studied at Aberdeen and then at Leyden University where he graduated in January 1749. At Leyden he had studied under Albert Schultens, the Dutch orientalist. He next went to Oxford studying Hebrew under Thomas Hunt. Robertson was offered the Chair of Hebrew in Doddridge's Theological Academy in Northampton, but instead became Professor of Hebrew at Edinburgh University on 25 June 1751 backed by a testimonial from Schultens. He compiled the Grammatica linguae Hebraeae (1758) and later on published The resemblance of Jesus to Moses considered (1765), and Clavis Pentateuchi (1770), the latter of which was a critical analysis of the Hebrew version of the Pentateuch. Between the years 1763 and 1785, Robertson was also the University Librarian and with a small team he compiled the Library's first alphabetical catalogue. James Robertson retired from the Chair of Hebrew in 1792. After some years of physical infirmity, he died at Middlefield, Leith, in Edinburgh, on 26 November 1795.

Ursula Mary Keppel-Compton was born in Southampton, England, in 1907. She was a graduate of Oxford University, St. Hugh's College, and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York from which she graduated as Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.). In 1931 she married the American theologian Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971). They made New York City their home. During the 1930s she was a lay minister preaching in Anglican churches and in this capacity she raised questions about the the role of women in the church. From 1940, and first as a lecturer, she was a member of the Barnard College faculty for some 20 years. She retired in the 1960s and died on 10 January 1997. John Baillie was born in 1886. He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force, then an academic career followed. He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retiral six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, becoming a President of the latter. He died in 1960.

The Edinburgh University Sailing Club (EUSC) was founded in 1933 as the Edinburgh University Yacht Club. EUSC is one of the largest sports clubs within the University and its dinghy teams are the most successful teams in Scotland. EUSC is located at the Edinburgh University Sports Union, Pleasance, Edinburgh. Club sailing takes place at Linlithgow Loch, West Lothian, for dinghies, and Largs (Clyde) and Port Edgar (Forth) for yachting. The EUSC is a group member of the Linlithgow Loch Sailing Club. In the 1980s and 1990s EUSC meetings were held on Tuesdays in the Pleasance, and in more recent years at the Wash Bar, Mound, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evenings. The EUSC Cameron Trophy sailing event has been held at Firbush - the University's field centre on Loch Tay - and in the Firth of Forth (the 35th Cameron Trophy was hosted by the Royal Forth Yacht Club). The Trophy has traditionally been held over a weekend during Freshers Week at Firbush, or rather during the weekend immediately before the start of the Autumn term. Club records also show that there has been a Sailing Club Regatta held in in May. The Club has held grand social events such as the Edinburgh University Watersports Ball which was often held at the Prestonfield House Hotel, Edinburgh, but was, in November 1989, held at the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, as well as dinner dances, Hallowe'en, Christmas and Burns functions. Some of these still happen, along with beer and skittles and pub quizzes. The above-mentioned Cameron Trophy had been presented by Lord Cameron to the Edinburgh University Sports Union in the early 1970s. Lord Cameron had served with the RNVR in both world wars and in the Second World War had held the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. He was an honorary commodore of the Forth Yacht Club and was awarded an honorary blue for his interest in Edinburgh University sport. He held a particular interest in sailing and so the Sports Union decided to invite the EUSC to run an annual regatta at which the winner would be presented with the Cameron Trophy which he had presented. Earlier in the Club's history the trophy was called the Lord Cameron Trophy. Lord Cameron died in 1996, aged 96.

This is a substantial manuscript book of poems all written by Josiah Conder - quarto, 4-page index followed by 192-pages of poetry, and containing 79 poems. Most of the poems are dated and a few towards the end of the volume are signed. The poems were all written by Conder when he was aged between fifteen and nineteen, and 25 of them may have been published in various places including Conder's first book, The associate minstrels (1810). Perhaps five of the 25 appeared in a children's annual, the Minor's pocket book for 1807 edited by Ann Taylor, daughter of Isaac Taylor. Several of the poems in the volume are signed from Colchester where the Taylors lived from 1796 until 1810 when they moved to Ongar. One of the poems is addressed to Isaac Taylor 'occasioned by his presenting me with a painting of Love, Joy and Mirth', dated 4 March 1806, and another 'To Mrs Taylor, Colchester. On her birthday, June 20, 1809'. The last two pages of the volume comprise a list of 'Verses written since the close of the year 1809', naming 29 poems written in 1810, 1811 and 1812.

Civil engineer and engineering contractor Sir John Jackson was born on 4 February 1851 in York. he was educated at Holgate Seminary near York, and in 1866 was apprenticed to William Boyd engineering works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1868 he began studies at Edinburgh University where he excelled in engineering, surveying and political economy. After University he returned to Newcastle where he worked for his brother, William Edwin Jackson.Jackson submitted a tender for Glasgow's Stobcross Docks which was completed in 1879. Earlier, in 1875, he founded his contracting business which would later become Sir John Jackson Ltd., in 1898. He completed Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 and he worked on the foundations of London's Tower Bridge. He had subsidiary companies in Bolivia, Canada, Chile, South Africa and Turkey, and owned a shipping line, the Westminster Shipping Company Ltd. His greatest work was the extension of the Admiralty works at Keyham, Devonport in 1896-1907. He undertook engineering works across the world, including: the naval harbour and graving dock at Simonstown, South Africa; harbour works in Singapore; the construction of a breakwater at Victoria BC; the naval dock at Ferrol, Spain; advice to the Austro-Hungarians on the extension of the Pola arsenal; the building of the Arica to La Paz railway in 1909, crossing the Andes at a height of 14,500 feet; irrigation works in Lebanon; and, irrigation works in Mesopotamia which involved a barrage across the Euphrates at Hindiyyah (Hindieh Barrage).Jackson was knighted in 1895. He was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh University, and in 1894 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1910 to 1918 he represented Devonport in Parliament as an MP for the Unionists. He was also awarded the Chilean Order of Merit and the Spanish Grand Cross of Naval Merit. In 1901 he was elected a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron.Sir John Jackson died on 14 December 1919.

The science writer and philosopher Thomas Dick was born in Hilltown, Dundee, on 24 November 1774. He was the son of a handloom weaver. He was inspired towards science on seeing a bright meteor in 1783. In 1794 he entered Edinburgh University supporting himself by private tutoring, but he did not proceed to taking the MA degree because of the additional fees. From 1801 he pursued a religious career, entering the Theological Hall of the General Associate Synod of the Secession Church. He was ordained in 1803, became married in 1804, but in 1805 was deposed and excommunicated from the presbytery on being found guilty of adultery. In 1807 Dick turned to teaching, becoming a schoolmaster in Methven and forming a mechanics' institute. In 1817 he left Methven for Perth and a post at Stewart's Free Trades' School. As well as teaching he involved himself in astronomical observations and built a telescope. He published articles in literary, religious and scientific publications, and these included Christian philosopher, or, The connection of science and philosophy with religion (1832), Philosophy of religion (1826), Philosophy of a future state (1828), Celestial scenery (1837), and Practical astronomer (1845). Thomas Dick died on 29 July 1857.

In 1940, Auerbach began work on the effect of mustard gas on gene mutation, together with Pio Koller. The work was initially suggested by A.J. Clark of the Pharmacology Department at the University of Edinburgh, who had a contract with the Chemical Defence Establishment of the War Office to study the biological effects of mustard gas. Auerbach and Koller teamed up with Clark and J.M. Robson in Pharmacology to expose Drosophila flies to mustard gas. Striking results were obtained almost immediately, and by 1942 they could show conclusively that mustard gas was mutagenic. Due to the confidential nature of the work, the findings were not published until 1946 in a series of joint papers by Auerbach and Robson. Auerbach received the prestigious Keith Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, but the credit she was to receive for the work caused great annoyance to Robson, despite Auerbach's assertion that the Prize should have been awarded jointly.

David Smith was born in South Wales on 21 May 1930. He was educated at Colston's School, Bristol, and at St. Paul's School, London, and then studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded the degrees of B.A. (first class honours in Botany), 1951, and Ph.D., 1954. After National Service, his academic career continued with a research fellowship at Queen's and he was Harkness Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Smith was back in Oxford in 1960, this time holding a University Lectureship in the Department of Agricultural Science, as well as an appointment as Royal Society Senior Research Fellow, then Tutorial Fellow and Admissions Tutor at Wadham College. In 1975, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Smith then held the Melville Wills Chair of Botany at the University of Bristol, and in 1980 he became Professor of Rural Economy at the University of Oxford and Head of the Department of Agricultural Science. In 1986 he was knighted, and in 1987 he was appointed Principal of Edinburgh University in succession to John Harrison Burnett. The published work of Sir David Smith centres on the biology of symbiosis and was initially concerned with associations between algae and fungi, and latterly with a variety of associations between algae and animals. With A. Douglas he publishedThe biology of symbiosis(1987). During his period as Principal at Edinburgh, the University was confronted by challenges in the area of teaching (staff-student ratios), in research (assessments), and in financial policy, but through the resourceful leadeship that Smith provided, the University had been able to strengthen these areas again by the time that he retired in 1994. Sir David Smith's portrait was painted by Scottish painter and printmaker Dame Elizabeth Blackadder (b. 1931) and it was unveiled on 21 March 1994. From April 1994 to 2000, Sir David Smith was President of Wolfson College, Oxford.

In the 17th century, glass slides were already being projected using a 'magic lantern' - or early form of the projector. However, in 1850, in Philadelphia, USA, the transparent positive image of a photograph in the form of a glass slide was invented by William and Frederick Langenheim - two Daguerreotypists. Their 'hyalotype' (from Greek 'hyalo' for glass) or black and white photographic glass slide could be projected onto a wall or screen using a 'magic lantern' lit by oil lamps. By 1870, limelight - a dazzling white light produced by directing a very hot flame onto the surface of a pellet of lime - offered a better, although more dangerous, form of illumination. The earliest and simplest form of limelight was the oxy-calcium lamp. The flame of a spirit lamp was placed near the pellet of lime and a jet of oxygen was used to raise the temperature of the flame and force it against the surface of the lime to produce its brilliant white light. An even brighter limelight could be produced using an oxygen and hydrogen jet. In the 1890s, the invention of the carbon arc lamp, followed by electric light, provided a safe method for displaying the lantern slide image. By 1873, Bruno Meyer, a German art historian at the Polytechnic Institute in Karlsruhe, was using projected lantern slides in art history lectures, and actually started to manufacture what he called 'glasphotogramme' which he sold at two marks a piece. When the new electric 'magic lantern' projectors were introduced in 1892, the technology was enthusiastically adopted by Hermann Grimm, a professor of art history at the University of Berlin. In an article published in 1897, he reported how lantern slides permitted the projection of works full-size, or allowed small works or fragments to be enlarged to colossal scale. Grimm's successor at Berlin was Heinrich Wölfflin who also embraced the new technology In 1916, a process for producing colour lantern slides had been invented by the German company Agfa, but because of the war it did not become available outside Germany until the 1920s. Use of lantern slides lasted until the 1950s when their popularity began to decline with the introduction of smaller transparencies and then, finally, in 1936, the discovery of the Kodachrome three-color process made the 35mm format slides less expensive to produce than lantern slides. Beginning in 1938, the transparencies were presented in the now familiar card mounts. Although the production of lantern slides ended in the 1950s, many academic slide collections still house and use glass slides. In some cases, the views that they represent are either drastically changed or no longer exist and thus they are invaluable images of the world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In 1976, Beale was awarded a Royal Society Visiting Professorship to spend six months at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, lecturing on his Edinburgh work on the genetics of malaria parasites. During this visit he began a collaborative research programme on malaria parasites with some interested Thai scientists, including Professor Sodsri Thaithong. Beale would visit Bangkok annually for the following 20 years to assist with the work, which involved making collections of Plasmodium falciparum from different malarial endemic areas of Thailand and characterising the cultured parasites in various ways, including enzyme typing and drug resistance testing. Ultimately, over 1000 separate isolates were obtained and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Beale also developed a new technique for preparing pure clones of malaria parasites by micromanipulation (Beale and Thaithing, 1991). The malaria work led to a great deal of collaboration between the two research groups in Edinburgh and Thailand, and in 1992 Beale and Thaithong published a book summarising their work. Beale received an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University in 1996.

The second edition of Holinshed's history of Britain was the edition used by William Shakespeare as the principal source for his histories and also for Macbeth.  The printing history of this work is of particular interest. In February 1587, the printers were ordered by the Privy Council and the Archbishop of Canterbury to delete nine passages that contained objectionable accounts of recent history - three in volume II (Scotland), six in volume III (England). The Privy Council censored text, but of course the printers had to cancel whole leaves, 82 leaves in all. Most surviving copies of the work were duly 'castrated' to order, and cancels (only twelve of them) were inserted to bridge the gaps. In the eighteenth century the original text was reprinted three times from an 'uncastrated' copy or copies, and after 1722 or 1723 these reprinted leaves were generally used to complete later-bound collectors' sets in facsimile. As an interesting aside, some original leaves could escape the Privy Council knife, as in one instance in this Edinburgh University Library copy, where in volume III, there are untouched leaves relating to a report of English support for the Duke of Alençon's departure in 1582 to assume sovereignty of Zeeland. This was an unhappy episode which was to mark a failure in Elizabeth's policy in the Low Countries. The cancel is said to reduce the report from 362 lines to 12. This Edinburgh copy also includes 4 of the original 1587 cancel leaves inserted loose alongside their 18th century facsimile replacements (representing, in volume II, pp. 421, 424, 438, 431, 443, 444, 445 and 450).

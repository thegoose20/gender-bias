Susan Anderson Binnie was born on 19 June 1898, at Lynmill, Avonbridge, Stirlingshire. She was the sister of John Binnie, born in 1894. She was educated at Airdrie Academy, and then from 1915 she studied medicine at Edinburgh University where she was among the first women allowed to study with male medical students. Binnie graduated with the degrees of MB and ChB in the early 1920s. Her brother had also graduated as a doctor, and during the First World War he served on submarines. In the post-War years, John Binnie set up a medical practice in Midcalder and Susan Binnie worked for him in the practice for a short while. She then worked as a pathologist at Bangour Hospital, West Lothian. On 4 July 1925, at Lynmill, Avonbridge, Binnie married Donald Moodie, an artist on the staff of Edinburgh College of Art. As a young married woman with two small children - Kathleen and Margaret - she found it difficult to keep her medical career going, but she was able to undertake a few locums in the Highlands and Islands, on Papa Westray in Orkney, and on Coll, and in Easter Ross. She twice tried to return to medicine full-time but this just wasn't to be. Susan Anderson Binnie (Mrs Susan A. Moodie) died on 27 March 1975, in Edinburgh.

Thomson argues that the talents of the individual should be discovered and encouraged, rather than quashed because they are not intellectual enough. He discusses the uses of examinations and intelligence testing in discovering talent, and the need for tests of non-verbal as well as verbal ability.

Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit was born in 1585. He was the brother-in-law of William Drummond of Hawthornden, the poet. Scott was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, entering it around 1600. He then studied abroad before returning to Scotland having been called to the Bar. In 1611 he acquired Tarvet and other land in Fife to which he gave the name Scotstarvet. In 1617 he was knighted by King James VI and was made a Privy Councillor.Sir John married three times. His first wife was Anne Drummond, the sister of Drummond of Hawthornden, his second was Elizabeth Melville, and his third Margaret Monpenny.Scott was an important supporter and patron of Scottish learning. He endowed the Chair of Humanity at St. Andrew's in 1620 and was responsible for advancing two major patriotic publication projects - theDelitiae poetarum Scotorum(1637) and the Scottish maps forBlaeu's Atlas Novus(1654). In honour of James VI he published a Latin poemHodoeporicon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scotia sua discessum.His late seventeenth century workThe Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmenwas a reflection on the instability of success, including his own fall from office after years of service to king and country.In 1637, when Charles I insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland, and brought bishops into government, it incited revolution in the form of the National Covenant which was signed at Greyfriar's Kirk, Edinburgh, in 1638, by nobles, ministers and thousands of ordinary Scots. That same year, at the parish church in Ceres, Fife, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet subscribed to the Covenant too. The Covenant demanded a free Scottish Parliament and a free General Assembly - free from the monarch's interference. In 1640, he served on the committee of the Estates for the defence of the country (the Estates was the then Scottish Parliament). During the ensuing war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649.Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit had been a Privy Councillor both to James VI and to King Charles I, and a Lord of Session, and Lord of Exchequer (Scotland). However, during Cromwell's Commonwealth he lost his positions of high office. These would not be given back to him after the Restoration either. He died at Scotstarvet in 1670.In the 18th century the estate of Scotstarvet was bought by Wemyss of Wemyss Hall (Wemyss Hall, near Cupar, Fife).

The body of the letter is probably in the hand of a secretary, although the signature itself is thought to be that of Adam Ferguson. The letter dated 16 November 1815, St. Andrews, was written only 3-months or so before his death. The letter is to 'Dear Sir' and bears the address, James Chalmer Esq.r. / Abingdon Street / Westminster / London The letter refers to how on 'the other leaf of this paper' there is 'the original of a letter' which will explain itself. 'How a claim of mine founded upon it has originated is not material'. All he means 'is hereby to empower' James Chalmer 'to receive the contents in my behalf if any such be forthcoming'. He has 'requested the Bankers at Edinburgh to concur in giving' Chalmer 'the same power'. He has no doubt that Coutts (presumably the banking house of Coutts) 'upon the sight of this paper will also concur'. What Ferguson wanted was that 'whatever money should be so obtained may be laid out in the purchase of an Annuity' for his son, Adam Ferguson, 'and in any Fund either publick or private is properly secured for his life'.  The letter does not include 'the other leaf'.

John Baillie was born in 1886, the son of Rev John Baillie ( 1829-1891), Free Church minister at Gairloch, Ross & Cromarty in the north-west of Scotland, and his wife Annie Macpherson. John (senior) was a graduate of both the University of Edinburgh and Free Church College, Edinburgh Following the death of his father in 1891, the family home was at Inverness and John (junior) was educated at Inverness Royal Academy and the University of Edinburgh. More study was undertaken at both the universities of Jena and Marburg and he held assistant positions at the University of Edinburgh before entering the church, as an assistant in 1912 and then being ordained in 1920. The First World War saw Baillie playing an active role in both the YMCA and the British Expeditionary Force. The end of that war saw his marriage to Florence Jewel Fowler and the start of his academic career . He held a number of chairs at the Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries, New York, and at Emmanuel College, Toronto, but he eventually returned to Edinburgh to become Professor of Divinity at New College in 1934. The advent of the Second World War saw Baillie use the North American links he had maintained to help persuade US entry into the conflict. He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and became Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at Edinburgh in 1950, holding this position until retrial six years later. As part of the ecumenical movement, John Baillie was member of both the British Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches; he became a President of the latter.

Mary R. E. Ringsleben was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from Aberdeen University in 1956 for her thesis entitled Gavin Douglas: a revaluation. She had been in contact with Scottish writer and poet Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve) concerning her work on Douglas, and he had lauded her work. In another realm entirely, Mary Ringsleben would become an original signatory of the Committee of 100, which was founded on the initiative of Ralph Schoenman and Bertrand Russell in October 1960. This Committee called for a mass movement of civil disobedience against British government policy on nuclear weapons. Its members saw a need for more radical methods than those used by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, especially following the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1959 general election. Based in Leeds, Ringsleben was an organiser of the Northern Direct Action Committee.

Edward Adrian Wilson (Wilson of the Antarctic) was born in Cheltenham on 23 July 1872. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and at St. George's Hospital, London. Dr. Wilson was an accomplished self-taught artist and field naturalist. Although he had contracted tuberculosis during his work in the slums of London, he was appointed as the Assistant Surgeon and Vertebrate Zoologist to the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-1904) aboard 'Discovery', under Commander Robert Falcon Scott (1868-1912). On the return of the Expedition he was appointed Field Observer to the Grouse Disease Inquiry. He also illustrated wildlife books. In 1910 Wilson returned to the Antarctic with Captain Scott aboard the vessel 'Terra Nova' as Chief of the Scientific Staff. The Expedition reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, but only after the Norwegian Expedition under Roald Amundsen had gotten there first. Edward Adrian Wilson BA, MB (Cantab.), FZS died on the Great Ice Barrier around 29 March 1912 along with his fellow explorers on the return journey from the Pole.

Stanley Eric Francis Booth-Clibborn, Church Missionary Society missionary in Kenya and Bishop of Manchester, was born on 20 October 1924 into the family that founded the Salvation Army. Throughout his life he sought to combine his belief in Christianity with the promotion of social justice and the support of the poor and oppressed. He spent four years in the army, including two in India, then went to Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA (1951) and MA (1956). In 1950 he had studied at Westcott House in Cambridge and in 1952 he was ordained a deacon and a year later a priest. His first posts as a curate were in Sheffield (1952-56) but he was then accepted as a missionary to Kenya. Booth-Clibborn arrived in Africa in 1956 where he was to have varied ecumenical responsibilities included editingRockandTarget, influential church newspapers in East Africa. He was especially concerned to promote church unity and the development of the African church leadership during the political upheaval around the time of the Mau Mau rebellion. On returning to England in 1967 Booth-Clibborn became a minister in Lincoln but was also involved with the International Affairs Department of the British Council of Churches, and his wife Anne (nee Forrester) was Vice-Chair of Christian Aid for a time. He then moved to Cambridge in 1970 spending 9 years at St Mary the Great. From 1979 he was Bishop of Manchester and regarded with great affection and respect even by those who disagreed with his with his views, he was, for example, a strong supporter of women's ordination. He retired in 1992 and went, with his wife, to live in Edinburgh. His interest in Africa had continued and the Booth-Clibborns were invited by the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), in co-operation with Christian Aid, to monitor the 1992 Kenyan elections. The Rt. Rev. Stanley Booth-Clibborn died on 6 March 1996.

      12 - Letter to Levison, from George Combe, 7 August 1829, in which concern is expressed about the Phrenological journal and how 'we came to the resolution of condensing our page, and putting into 6 sheets nearly as much matter as our present 10 contain, and reducing the price to 2/6 each number', and in which he states that 'If this step, of lowering the price and appealing to our readers does not bring an accession of subscribers, we must submit to our fate'

The letter is dated 28 February 1887, at 10 Bright['s] Crescent, presumably in Edinburgh. It appears to begin, 'Dear Prof. Dunn'.

He remarks how it is 'a terrible loss to the Society in the death of our dear friend Mr. Gray!' It finishes with autograph signature, James Geikie. There is also a printed outline map of Scotland showing principal directions of ice-flow. Both the map and the letter (which had been pasted to the inside cover) had been extracted from a copy of Geikie's Great Ice Age and its relation to the antiquity of man (1874).

Materia medica is the Latin medical term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing - it is 'medicines', or 'materials used for medicine'. In modern terms, this is 'pharmacology'. The treatise of materia medica, or compilation of medical substances, that forms this manuscript collection might be called a 'pharmacopoeia'. The earliest such compilations were those supporting the (Ayurvedic) system of traditional Indian medicine from the 6th century BC. There were Greek and Chinese compilations too, then those from the later medieval Islamic world. In 1025, Avicenna, the Perisan polymath, physician and philosopher, introduced hisCanon of medicinewhich is considered the first pharmacopoeia. By the 13th century AD, Ibn al-Baitar (from Andalusia) had described more than 1,400 different plants, foods and drugs, over 300 of which were his own original discoveries. His teacher, the botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, introduced scientific techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. North Vigor, from England, was awarded his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1747. His thesis or dissertation wasDe Diabete. It was during studies at Edinburgh, and attending classes offfered by Dr. Charles Alston, that he would have written down the notes of materia medica that comprise this collection. Vigor became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 1758. Charles Alston was born at Eddlewood (now part of Hamilton). He was educated in Glasgow, and then went to Leyden in the Netherlands to study medicine under Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). There he met Dr. Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767). Together, on their return to Edinburgh, they revived medical lectures at the University with Alston being appointed Lecturer in Botany and Materia Medica. He was also Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. Alston published various medical papers and an index to the plants in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. In hisTirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense(1753), he attacked the Linnaean system of classification. Dr. Charles Alston died on 22 November 1760.

The percussionist James Blades OBE was born in Peterborough, England, on 9 September 1901. He had a diverse early career - joining a circus when he was fourteen and playing cymbals and a bass drum, performing in local brass bands, being an engineering apprentice, and working in a cinema creating sound effects for silent films. In 1932 though, he joined the London Film Society orchestra and he was famous for playing the gong which began the films made by J. Arthur Rank studios (the Rank Organisation) though the film recording of this was mimed by Bombardier Billy Wells, a boxer. In 1940, Blades joined the London Symphony Orchestra. During the Second World War, BBC broadcasts to resistance movements in Europe were begun with a recording of Morse code for V-for-Victory played by Blades with a tympany mallet striking an African membrane drum. After the war he worked with operas, symphonies, and chamber music, and he was invited to participate in the Coronation Orchestra in Westminster Abbey 1953 for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1954 Blades became Professor of Percussion at the Royal Academy of Music. He lectured and also worked with physically and mentally handicapped children. He wrote Orchestral percussion technique (1961), Percussion instruments and their history (1970), and A Check-List of the Percussion Instruments in the Edinburgh University Collection of Historic Musical Instruments (1982). With Jeremy Montagu he wrote Early percussion instruments: from the Middle Ages to the Baroque (1976), and with Johnny Dean How to play drums (1985), and, with a foreword by Evelyn Glennie, he wrote These I have met...: reminiscences (1998). James Blades OBE died on 19 May 1999 in Cheam, Surrey, In England.

David John Wauchope Dundas was born on 3 February 1886. He was one of two sons of Colin Mackenzie Dundas, Commander R.N., of Ochtertyre, Stirlingshire (1842-1902) and Agnes, second daughter of the late Samuel Wauchope, Esq., C.B. In the 1900s, Dundas studied at Edinburgh University and these studies included lectures on Agriculture and Entemology given by William Fream (1854-1906) who in 1890 had become the first Steven lecturer at Edinburgh on agricultural entomology, and also by Professor Robert Wallace (1853-1939) who - like Fream - had previously been on the staff of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. On 14 February 1920, Dundas married Winifred Hersey MacKenzie, the youngest daughter of Colin James MacKenzie WS., JP., of Portmore. David John Wauchope Dundas lived at Woodhouselee, Milton Bridge, Midlothian, and at Machany House, Perthshire, and died on 24 September 1938, pre-deceasing his wife who died in July 1946. Their son, William John Dundas (1923-1965), was a survivor of the sinking of HMS Hood by the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941.

William Hunter was born on 1 June 1861 in Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast. He was educated at Ayr Academy, and then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1883 with M.B., C.M. (1st Class) 1883, and M.D. (Gold Medal) 1886. He served as a house physician at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and as a Physican to the Western Dispensary, Edinburgh. He had also studied overseas at Leipzig in 1884 with a grant from the BMA, and during the period 1887-1890 he visited Vienna and Strasbourg. Also during 1887-1890 he worked full time on laboratory research at Cambridge, devoting himself to pernicious anaemia. From 1895, Hunter was affiliated with the Charing Cross Hospital and the London Fever Hospital. Earlier, in 1894, he married Beatrice Fielden, daughter of Joshua Fielden MP. He was the first person to note that the alimentary and the nervous system were often affected in pernicious anaemia, and he regarded the haemolytic element as being most important and made numerous observations on the excessive pigmentation and iron deposition in the liver. Hunter, along with Julius Otto Ludwig Moeller, is associated with 'Hunter's glossitis' caused by B12 or folic acid deficiency ('Moeller-Hunter glossitis'), and he is also associated with the 'Serbian barrel' used for disinfection and the eradication of lice during the First World War in Serbia. During the First World War, Hunter served in Serbia with the British Military Sanitary Mission where he developed de-lousing techniques to control typhus. He was appointed as a Grand Officer of the Serbian Order of St. Sava in June 1915. In December 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches and was awarded the Companion Order of the Bath (CB). He was President of the Advisory Committee, Prevention of Disease, in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesopotamia (Gallipoli, Egypt, Salonika, Malta and Palestine), and he served with the Eastern Command, 1917-1919, as Consulting Physician. He held the rank of Colonel. Hunter's published work includesOral sepsis as a cause of 'Septic gastritis', 'Toxic neuritis' and other septic conditions(1901),Pernicious anaemia: its pathology, septic origin, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Based upon original investigations(1901),A research into epidemic and epizootic plague(1904),Severest anaemias. Their infective nature, diagnosis and treatment(1909),Historical account of Charing Cross hospital and medical school (University of London): original plan and statutes, rise and progress(1914), andThe Serbian epidemics of typhus and relapsing fever in 1915(1920). He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP London 1896) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and he was awarded an Honorary LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1927. William Hunter died on 13 January 1937.

Terraces on Arthur's Seat could refer to other theories about their origins: "? Traces of trenches thrown up (1778) by mutinous Seaforth Highlanders. Discontent having arisen in connection with their departure for India, several hundreds of men attacked their officers on the Esplanade, and then held their position there (i.e. on Arthur's Seat) for several days until a free pardon was offered them." ('The New Illustrated Guide to Edinburgh' 10th ed. By John Reid, Pub: Andrew Elliot, 1905, p. 87). Hearsay also suggests, perhaps confusing this report, that the terraces are the remains of fortifications dug during the Napoleonic War when invasion was threatened. It is also possible that they may have used older terraces mentioned by Frank Mears.

James D. Macgregor was born in Invergowrie, near Dundee, on 21 August 1927. He was the son of Margaret (Robertson) and Alexander Macgregor. His father was Headmaster of the local school, Invergowrie Public School, the school attended by Macgregor until the age of ten. His secondary schooling was at Perth Academy. Between 1945 and 1950 he studied at St. Andrews University where he graduated with the degree of MBChB. After graduation, Macgregor worked in general practice in Perth and Bridge of Earn before becoming House Physician at Perth Royal Infirmary. In 1951, he was appointed as House Surgeon at the Royal Northern Infirmary in Inverness. Prior to his 'call up' to National Service he was serving at Scartho Infirmary (Grimsby District General Hospital) in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire, England. At this point, he joined the Colonial Medical Service and towards the end of 1951 he began a first tour of duty in Freetown, Sierra Leone (know then as the Sierra Leone Protectorate), at the Connaught Hospital there. By the age of 25 Macgregor had become Assistant Surgeon at the hospital. He also ran the Mental Hospital at Kissy which, even in 2006, is the only psychiatric facility in Sierra Leone. This first tour of duty lasted until March 1953. Macgregor's second tour of duty began with his appointment as District Medical Officer for Makeni District at its population of some 360,000 most of whom were spread over a very wide area. Assisting him were two doctors and an American missionary. This second tour lasted until the end of 1954 when he joined the Colonial Service as a permanent and pensionable officer. In April 1955, Macgregor married a student from Edinburgh and the couple then travelled back to Freetown where he was to serve at the Hill Station Hospital (now called Choithrams Hospital). In 1956 he was posted to Magburaka in the Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone and to a new hospital there. Promotion followed, and Macgregor was posted to the Solomon Islands (then known as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate) as Senior Medical Officer. The journey to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, on Guadalcanal, took two months by an Orient Line vessel - SS Oronsay - to Sydney, then tramp steamer. While on the Solomon Islands three children were born to the family. In 1975 Macgregor returned to the UK with his family to take up an appointment as Chief Medical Officer for the Shetland Islands - the Shetland Health Board. In 1981 he became District Medical Officer in Perth - Tayside Health Board. He retired in 1993. In retirement he has acted as secretary for a variety of bodies and has also been Medical Officer for Tayside Fire Brigade and for Fife Fire and Rescue Service.

Rosalind Mary Wrong was born on 11 April 1919. She was the eldest daughter of the Oxford mathematician Edward Murray Wrong (1889-1928) and Rosalind Grace Wrong (Smith) (1892-1983), and grand-daughter of the Canadian historian George M. Wrong (1860-1948). She was educated at Dragon School, Oxford, 1926-1931, St. Paul's Girls School, Hammersmith, 1931-1932, and at Channing School, Highgate, 1934-1938. She then studied Mathematics and Modern History at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, 1938-1942. After her own university studies, she became an Assistant Lecturer at Manchester University in 1943, and then Tutor at Lady Margaret Hall in 1946. Part-time tutoring at Cambridge's Pembroke and Girton Colleges followed, then in June 1947 Rosalind Mary Wrong married the scientist John Murdoch Mitchison, son of novelist and poet Naomi M. Mitchison (1897-1999). In 1953, the couple moved to Edinburgh with their growing family. J. Murdoch Mitchison was appointed Professor of Zoology, Edinburgh University, in 1963. Shortly after the move, Rosalind Mary Mitchison became an Assistant at the History Department, Edinburgh University in 1954, and then from 1958 she was a part-time Assistant at Economic History. From 1959 she did part-time work for the History of Parliament Trust, and then from 1962 she taught at the Scottish History Department, Glasgow University. In 1966 Mitchison was teaching part-time at Edinburgh University again, and then in 1967 she became a Lecturer in Economic History, then Reader in 1976. One of her students had been the politician, Gordon Brown. In 1981, Mitchison was appointed Professor of Social History at the University. Mitchison's publications spanned seven decades from the 1940s to 2001, and include:Agricultural Sir John(1962);A history of Scotland(1970);Life in Scotland(1978);Lordship to patronage: Scotland 1603-1745(1983);Why Scottish history matters(1990); and,The old poor law in Scotland(2000). Mitchison officially retired in 1986 but continued to research, teach, write and publish, holding a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship until 1988. Rosalind Mary Mitchison died in Edinburgh on 20 September 2002, and she was cremated on 30 September 2002. Mitchison had been described as 'the 20th century's foremost exponent of the social history of Scotland' (The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2002), and by Tam Dalyell as 'a pioneering social historian' (The Independent21 October 2002).

Alexander Monro, secundus, younger son of Alexander Monro, primus (1697-1767), was born in Edinburgh on 20 May 1733. He was educated at Mr. Mundell's School in the city, and in 1752 he entered Edinburgh University to pursue medical studies. From 1753, he occasionally lectured for his father who was Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, and in July 1755 he became Joint Professor with his father. In October 1755 he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the subject of his dissertation being De Testibus et Semine in variis Animalibus . After graduating he went to London to attend William Hunter's lectures, then visited Paris, Leyden, and Berlin. In 1758 he succeeded his father as Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh University and the following year he was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He became President of that body in 1779. His works included Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system  (1783), Structure and physiology of fishes explained and compared with those of man and other animals  (1785), Bursae Mucosae  (1788), and The brain, the eye, and the ear  (1797). Between 1798 to 1808, Monro shared the Professorship with his son, Alexander Monro, tertius (1773-1859). Monro died on his estate at Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, on 2 October 1817.  The Dictionary of national biography writes that 'In the fifty years he taught at Edinburgh University Monro Secundus became the most influential anatomy professor in the English speaking world'.

This project aimed to make significant improvements in technologies for the multiplication of bovine embryos by combining methods for in vitro maturation of oocytes and in vitro culture of embryos with existing nuclear transfer technology. The second main objective was to develop embryonic stem cells from cattle embryos by culture techniques and to investigate opportunities for using the nuclei of such cells for transplantation, and the generation of embryos on an extensive scale. Funding was provided by the Milk Marketing Board, the Meat and Livestock Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry. The work was carried out jointly by the Cambridge and Edinburgh Research Stations of the AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research, and was based within Animal Biotechnology Cambridge Ltd. The scientific director was E.J.C. Polge.

The civil engineer Thomas Archibald Campbell Brownlie was born on 6 September 1914, in Kasauli, India. His parents were Thomas Archibald Miller Brownlie (1879-1962) a civil engineer working in Faisalabad (now in modern Pakistan) and Jessie Forsyth Brownlie (Smith). When still a child he was brought to Scotland by his mother to live near Dunoon. After local early education he later went to Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, and then he studied Engineering at Edinburgh University. He graduated with the degree of B.Sc. in 1935 and then returned to India, working in the Punjab where he was involved in canal work. During World War II he served in the Indian Army as a Major, with the Bengal Sappers and Miners, commanding a company in Malaya and Burma. During the war, on 5 August 1941, he married Marjorie Bennetts (1921-2011). After the war (and Indian independence), Brownlie returned to Scotland and worked with the local authorities of both Dumfries and Fife. In 1950, he became County Engineer with Midlothian County Council before joining Lothian Region on the re-organisation of Scottish local government. Latterly he was Director of the Region's drainage services (Director of Drainage), and he had been responsible for its biggest single capital project - the multi-million pound Edinburgh Sewage Disposal Scheme including its sewage treatment plant at Seafield and the means to transfer sludge to the vessel M.V. 'Gardyloo' for disposal in the near North Sea. He retired from Lothian Region in September 1978. Thomas Archibald Campbell Brownlie died on 3 September 2010.

The photographs consist mainly of photographs of Alan Greenwood, staff from the Institute of Animal Genetics and Poultry Research Centre, their relations and visitors, and various events and conferences. There are also a number of photographs showing the construction and opening of the Poultry Research Centre building at Kings Buildings and the sub-station at Easter Bush. There appears to be a combination of official photographs taken, for instance, for a publication, and more informal snapshots. The photographs are mounted on sheets of foolscap paper which have been hole-punched and have presumably been removed from a folder at an earlier stage. The subjects of the pictures are often annotated, probably by Alan Greenwood.  Some sheets have photographs mounted on both sides, while other sheets have clearly had photographs removed. Except where noted, the photographs are in black and white. Many of the photographs are signed 'M.L', which denotes Miron Latyszewski, at that time a research officer at the Institute of Animal Genetics.

In the first letter dated 25 Jun 1938, Thomson thanks Ledermann for his corrections. He discusses unimodality and bimodality, vectors, and the distributions of loadings, referring to the work of Thurstone and Woodrow, as well as Ledermann's own method for finding the distribution of loadings. He also asks Ledermann if he has heard anything about his Home Office application. In the second later, dated 1 Jul 1938, Thomson asks Ledermann which part of the summer he is to have off, and discusses his analytical expression of the difference between profile correlations and partial correlations for mean score, referring to the work of Kelley and Thurstone. He also refers to profile correlations, stating that he doesn't quite understand them yet, but doesn't think Burt does either.

The volume - a scrapbook - contains newspaper cuttings in small part consisting of reviews of Purves-Stewart's notable published workDiagnosis of nervous diseases(1906). There are reviews from theBMJ, theAthenaeum(8 Dec. 1906);The Lancet(8 May 1909),La Clinique(12 Aout 1910), and theBulletin Medical de l'Algerie(Alger, 25 Aout 1910), but in large part consisting of controversial articles in the 1930s about Purves-Stewart's views on voluntary euthanasia and about the administration of euthanasia, on occasions, by physicians. There are a number of articles from theWestern Mail, from theCatholic Herald, from theDaily Sketch, and from other British newspapers. The scrapbook contains other cuttings mentioning Purves-Stewart in relation to Canadian hospitals in France, and his views on the Empire. There are a few cuttings relating to an international congress on hydrology in North Africa in 1909 at which he appears to have given a paper. There are also cuttings of jokes and verses.

This manuscript volume records medical case notes of male and female patients of the Edinburgh physicians James Gregory (1753-1821) and Daniel Rutherford (1749-1819) in November 1793. Members of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh volunteered on a monthly rotation to treat the impoverished sick at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and it seems likely that this is a record of clinical cases from the Infirmary. In 1790 the physician James Gregory had been appointed joint Professor of the Practice of Physic at Edinburgh University, augmenting the ageing William Cullen (1710-1790). On the death of Cullen soon afterwards, Gregory went on to hold the Chair alone for the rest of his life. He attacked the system of rotation of doctors to the Royal Infirmary on the grounds that patients were uncertain as to which physicians would treat them, and permanent medical staff were appointed eventually. The physician Daniel Rutherford was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1791. Rutherford was also considered to be one of the leading chemists of his generation. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians between December 1796 and December 1798.

This letter from Christabel Pankhurst to Mrs. Morrow [Hove], written 23 November 1913, from 11 avenue de la Grande Armee, Paris, discusses fund raising efforts and the appalling condition suffered by imprisoned suffragettes: 'This collection gives to all WSPU members and friends an opportunity to make a united demonstration of the kind which will impress the Government and the public and will prove the utter futility of torture [...] The prisoners are doing their part. It is for the rest of us to do ours and thus to show that the movement is financially as in every other way invincible'.  News clippings which form part of this collection include items relating to the unveiling by Stanley Baldwin - on Thursday 6 March 1930 - of a statue of Mrs. Pankhurst (Emily Pankhurst) in Victoria Tower Gardens (Houses of Parliament), London.

Thomson outlines the purpose of intelligence testing, referring to his own work in Northumberland in 1919, which was to ensure clever children weren't being passed over for entry into secondary education as a result of their social background. In relation to this, Thomson talks about the benefits of standardisation of intelligence tests, and discusses the problem of coaching and how it can be overcome. Thomson also mentions a child who was tested and subsequently given a place in secondary school, and who wrote to him many years later to let him know he had won the gold medal at the end of his university course.

Annie T. Altschul - an Austrian by birth - arrived in Britain with her mother in 1938, after the Anschluss. The Altschuls were a Jewish family. She trained as a nurse in London in the 1940s, and although qualifying as a general nurse and as a midwife, she found her niche in psychiatric nursing. After training at Mill Hill Emergency Hospital she moved to the merged Bethlem and Maudsley Hospitals and, while progressing from staff nurse to sister to Principal tutor, she also took a first class honours degree in Psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London. In 1964 she was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Nursing Studies at Edinburgh University. She then became a Senior Lecturer before being appointed to the Chair of Nursing Studies in 1976-77. Her publications includePsychiatric Nursing(1957), andPsychology for Nurses(1962). Altschul retired from the University in 1983, and on her retirement she was awarded the CBE and given the status of Professor Emeritus of Nursing Studies. Annie T. Altschul died on 24 December 2001.

Correspondence regarding Charlotte Auerbach's successful nomination for the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from Trinity College, Dublin
|
Elsie Gwenllian Taylor was born in Cardiff, Wales, on 24 April 1922. She studied at University College Cardiff, graduating in 1943 with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, and in 1944 with a Dip.Ed. From 1944 to 1946 she taught Mathematics at Mount School in York. In 1946 she came to Edinburgh to follow the B.Ed. course at the University of Edinburgh under Professor Godfrey Thomson. She was awarded the degree of B.Ed. in 1948. The following year she accepted a post at the Brighton College of Education teaching education and psychology. The experience was an unhappy one for Taylor, who resigned after one term. She wrote to Thomson explaining her predicament, and was offered a position at his education research unit, known as 'Room 70', undertaking administrative work on the Moray House Tests as well as holding the post of assistant lecturer at Moray House training college.  During her time at Moray House, Taylor worked as a Fulbright Scholar at the Educational Testing Service in New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures. In 1952, Taylor was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to spend a year at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey (1956-1964). Most of this year was spent drafting questions for the college entrance tests, though she also attended lectures.  Taylor's post at the Godfrey Thomson Research Unit terminated in 1956, and she became warden of Playfair Hall in East Suffolk Road, Edinburgh, a hall of residence for female Moray House students. During this time, she also worked as a tutor for first year Mathematics students. In 1964, she accepted the post of deputy secretary at the North Regional Examinations Board for the Certificate of Secondary Education, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She remained in this post until 1982, when she retired and moved to Orkney.

Edward Sang was born in Fife on 30 January 1805. He went to school in Kirkcaldy and already as a boy he showed an inclination towards mathematics. In 1818, Sang joined Edinburgh University when still a teenager, and studied mathematics. On leaving the University in 1822 he followed a career as a surveyor and civil engineer, and then became a teacher of mathematics in Edinburgh. In 1828, Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and he brought before the Society over one hundred papers on a wide variety of subjects covering mathematics, natural philosophy, astronomy, and engineering. In 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College, and shortly after that he travelled to Istanbul to help in the establishment of civil engineering in Turkey and in the building of railways there. In 1849 Sang was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1856 he read a paper on the gyroscope in relation to his suggestion of an experiment that would demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. Sang claimed that he had proved this by an experiment in 1836, pre-dating the experiment performed by Foucault. Edward Sang died on 23 December 1890

The name 'Napier' has variant spellings such as 'Naper', 'Napeer' and 'Napper' and others. The name was probably introduced to the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may derive from the word 'nappier', meaning 'linen', and used in an occupational sense as 'napperer' to describe the official at a royal court or a noble's castle; one who was in charge of the banquetting. Such positions were highly sought after, and often lead to the creation of noble families in their own right, with another example being the Stewards of Scotland who later became the royal family of Stuart. The Scottish Napier family, who once held the earldom of Lennox, are descended from the hereditary naperers to the kings of Scotland in the 12th Century. There have been many distinguished bearers of the name, including Sir Alexander Napier, the controller of the household of the Queen mother, 1449-1461, and who was also Scottish ambassador to England, 1451-1461. John Napier, (1550-1617), was the inventor of logarithms, and General Sir Charles James Napier, was the general of cavalry under the Duke of Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter Napier. This was dated 1148, in the Winton Rolls of Hampshire, during the reign of King Stephen of England, 1135-1154.

In 1967, Beatty and Anne McLaren applied jointly for a contination grant from the Ford Foundation to enable them to continue their work in Gamete Genetics (Beatty) and Reproductive Physiology (Anne McLaren) in the Reproductive Genetics Section. This application proved successful, and in July 1967, a grant of $151,000 was awarded to the University of Edinburgh to Beatty and Anne McLaren for a five year period in continued support of research in the genetics and physiology of reproduction. In 1971 the Ford Foundation suggested that Beatty and McLaren make an application for a second grant renewal before the expiry of the current grant.

The back of the present (1989) Deaconess Hospital is visible at the far end of the back greens, (the front is in the Pleasance, see Coll-1167/PSE/T/2). This building, now much altered and extended, dates from 1894 ('Buildings of Edinburgh', Gifford, McWilliam & Walker). Carnegie Street, not visible, was on the left; Brown Street, of which the back is shown here, on the right. The square-roofed extension at the left back of the hospital can still be identified, though a storey has been added. The three-storey separate building on the left no longer exists; perhaps it was an annex or staff quarters. This view is looking west.

The inventory includes mention of John Kennedy of Blairquhan and his chapel at St. Ninian's (1508). There is also the will of the jeweller and philanthropist, George Heriot (1563-1624), who left funds to Edinburgh's ministers to found the hospital which bore his name (now a school). In addition there are letters from Lord Salisbury, Fentoun (Alexander Erskine, Viscount Fentoun), and others, and including Scottish government letters of condolence on the death of Henry, Prince of Wales, 1611-1613. In reverse orientation there is an extract fromA Continuation of the History of Scotland by Way of Annals from the beginning of K. James VIth Reign. This is a bound manuscript, and an excellent complement to the Writs and Charters section component of the vast Laing collection.

Ruscelletto che vai scherzando by Emanuele d'Astorga

The material in the collection spans a period of 22 years from 1974 to 1996, and consists of several dozens of pages. The content tells of George Mackay Brown's annual cycle and his daily life, and particularly of visits of muses and other friends, as well as referring to publishing and contract matters. Included among the many individuals mentioned or referred to in the letters are: Ernest Marwick, Edwin Muir, Andrew Motion, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Hermann Palsson, Simon Fraser, Esther Garke, Gunnie Moberg, Sigrid Mavor, Renee Simm, Nora Kennedy, and latterly Surinder Punjya whom he had first met in 1991. Included among the Brown works referred to in the letters, in various contexts, but mostly in the passing, are: Magnus, Calendar of Love, Greenvoe, Christmas Poems, An Orkney Tapestry, The Winter Song, Loom of Light, The Lamb, Christmas Stories, Portrait of Orkney, The Golden Bird, Scottish Bestiary, The Game of Chess , The Ballad of John Voe, The Masked Fisherman, Fankle the Cat, The Road to Colonus, Archangel, Tryst on Egilsay, Beside the Ocean of Time, Time in a Red Coat often abbreviated by Brown to TIARC, Selected Poems, Following a Lark, Winter Tales, and Pictures in the Cave. Often the references are to the numerous foreign translations of his work, or to corrections to his work, suggestions for the material, illustrations and illustrators for it, and other publishing matters and themes. A letter dated 8 February 1974, Stromness, is a copy, the original of which was retained by Hugo Brunner. The letter refers to the birth of one of Brunner's sons, the godfather of whom was George Mackay Brown. In the letter he talks of how he 'always finds these articles about myself hugely embarrassing, like suddenly coming on one's image in a distorting mirror.' He also refers to 'Poor Jo Grimond - I don't envy him, electioneering in a northern winter. I think he'll keep his seat all right, in spite of having 2 eager young men against him'. 1974 was to be the year of two General Elections in Britain, the first being held in February 1974, and a second in October. A letter dated 11 June 1985, Stromness, tells of how Brown 'dined in the big hotel with a group of elderly French people from the French-Scottish Association. The food was rather wretched, but the French folk, who are here till Friday, seemed to be enjoying Orkney. I don't know what they'll think of Brodgar and Skarabrae in this rain...' He also refers to a coming visit he will be making to central Scotland. 'As for Glasgow,' he writes, 'I resign myself to Providence'. A UK general election is again referred to in a letter dated 11 June 1987, Stromness, in which he thinks he will 'go and vote for the Green candidate'. Later on the letter describes how he 'Lay in bed till 3 am listening to Election results - v. depressing. I was rather proud of the way Scotland had thrown out so many Tories. A kind of terrifying Boadicea is running the land. My Orkney 'Green' candidate forfeited his deposit, of course'. On book prizes he has this to say, 11 March 1988, Stromness: 'The James Tait Black prize doesn't cause such a stir nowadays as it used to do. It's all Whitbread and Booker!'  In January 1991 (letter 17 January 1991, Stromness) he refers to start of the war in Iraq and Kuwait which 'has been hanging like a shadow over us all winter. May it end soon', he writes, 'without the slaughter of too many innocents'. Brown's 70th birthday is referred to in letters dated 19 October 1991 and 24 October 1991, both from Stromness. In the former he writes that there are 'Still plenty of visitors and phone calls, but no mail (on account of the weather) after the profusion of mail all week'. BBC television had also marked the birthday. The BBC 'even did a snippet of me reading a poem on 17th: but I didn't see it'. The latter refers to how 'the pleasant little birthday storm has died down and I am trying to find place for the beautiful debris (presents) that came flooding in'. Brown was 'overwhelmed with kindness round the 17th' and he writes that he was expecting a visit from Sheena McDonald, the television broadcaster, who 'is coming to Orkney next week to give me a private view of the film she made in August'. There is a small body of copies of letters in the collection from Brown to 'Henry and Nancy', or simply to 'Henry' or to 'Nancy' - possibly in Michigan - and these cover the period September 1992 to July 1995. The final original letter in the collection from Brown to Brunner - also written from Stromness - is dated 'Good Friday '96' which was Friday 5 April 1996. George Mackay Brown died on 13 April 1996, eight days after the letter was written. In it, Brown writes about having 'been a bit off colour'. He wishes 'A happy Easter to all the Brunners, and to John Murray's people'.

Nuria Quevedo lives in Berlin, Germany, but was born in 1938 in Barcelona, Catalonia. Her family had emigrated to East Berlin in 1952. From 1958 to 1963 she studied at the Art School (Hochschule fuer bildende und angewandte Kunst) in Berlin-Weissensee, and then began working freelance in 1963. Between 1968 and 1971 she was a student at the Academy of Arts (Akademie der Kuenste) in the former German Democratic Republic (DDR), obtaining a master's degree there, and then from 1986 until 1991 she was a member of the Academy. From 1994 to 1996 she held a Professorship at Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald (the Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. From 1965, Quevedo exhibited widely in Germany (in Berlin, Chemnitz, Schwerin, Rostock, and Wittenberg) and in 1971 she held an exhibition in Montevideo, Uruguay.

The Church is on the right; Buccleuch Place beyond, looking south. This building is in Chapel Street, east of George Square beyond Windmill Lane. It is not open and is the property of Edinburgh University. It was built as a Chapel of Ease in 1755 ('Buildings of Edinburgh' by Gifford, McWilliam & Walker), hence, presumably, the name of Chapel Street.

It is believed that the majority of the moss samples contained in this album were collected in Scotland in the early 19th century. This can be dated from the paper of the album which is watermarked as Robert Weir, Carron (Grove Mill), 1828. The unknown botanist collector has included many fruiting specimens from locations including Tarbolton, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, Newton near Ayr, Dean Castle Kilmarnock, Stair, Craiglockhart, Carrick Hill, Edinburgh College Yard and Dalrymple. Modern notes at the rear of the album suggest that the botanist was working to the classification used in the second edition of Muscologia Britannica (1827) by Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865) - father of Joseph Dalton Hooker - and Thomas Taylor (1775-1848).

In Thomson's letter to Ledermann, dated 19 Jun 1939, he apologises for not replying to an earlier letter of Ledermann's and informs him that he will be happy to send him any of the letters he has written regarding his work from the last year, asking him to specify the subjects he is interested in. In his reply, dated 24 Jun 1939, Ledermann tells Thomson that he would like to look at the problem of maximising and minimizing the specifics, and that he has not managed to progress much with W G Madow's paper on multivariate statistical analysis.

The Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland, now subsumed by the Institute of Governance, was acknowledged as the leading centre in the country for studies of Scottish society and politics. At the centre of the Unit's work was the study of policy-making and the political process in Scotland, set in a broad comparative and international context. Constitutional change in Scotland had been one of the Unit's central themes since its founding in the mid-1970s for which it drew on diverse disciplines, notably in Law and Social Sciences. It conducted The Scottish Election Study, which provided an in-depth account of how and why Scotland voted at the 1997 General Election, especially in the context of long-term changes in electoral attitudes and behaviour. A similar study had focused on the Scottish Referendum in September 1997. The Unit was followed by the Governance of Scotland Forum in 1998, and then by the Institute of Governance in 2002 A number of publications had emanated from the Unit throughout the 1980s and 1990s on a variety of issues, including pieces on the re-organisation of Scottish local government, management of councils, financing Scottish home rule, gender and Scottish society, labour market policy in Britain, citizenship, Scottish churches and the political process, women in Scottish politics, data protection and privacy, and democratic participation in the Scottish Parliament.

Thomson begins by telling Ledermann he has sent his reference to Professor Goldsborough, and hopes this has an influence on his chances. He informs Ledermann that he is working on a new edition of The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and accordingly asks him about oblique factors, and oblique reference vectors , referring to the work of Thurstone. Thomson ends the letter by wishing Ledermann good luck in his job search.

Geoffrey Beale was a protozoologist and is credited as the founder of malarial genetics. He joined the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in 1947, where he was offered a lectureship by C.H. Waddington. Beale was eventually appointed a Royal Society Research Professor in 1963, a position he held until his retirement in 1978. At the Institute, Beale became close friends with Charlotte Auerbach, among others. Geoffrey Beale's biographical memoir of Charlotte Auerbach was published by the Royal Society in 1995. Beale also published an article 'The Discovery of Mustard Gas Mutagenesis by Auerbach and Robson in 1941', which appeared in Genetics, 134, 393-399 (1993).

Will Freshwater was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England, on 1 November 1872. He attended school locally and then was apprenticed to a local cabinet maker at the age of 14. Freshwater became a Sunday school teacher and began accompanying preachers from the town's Independent Chapel into some of the villages in the area. He also became interested in evangelical work at this time. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Birmingham becoming a member of the city's Westminster Road Congregational Church in December 1894. He continued with Sunday school work and evangelised in lodging houses open-air meetings, and grew interested in the Church's missionary work which was fostered by the minister, the Rev. Charles Deeble. After discussing his ambition with Deeble, in 1899 Freshwater decided to become a full-time missionary, and in September 1899 he was admitted to Harley College, the headquarters of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, in Bow, London. His training continued until January 1902 when he passed the examination of the London Missionary Society, and then he transferred to Livingstone College for a course in tropical medicine. Freshwater left London on 30 April 1902 bound for Africa aboard the 'S.S. Matabele' and to a tour of duty at Mbereshi Mission Station, 1902-1907 (Mbereshi being in modern Zambia). In 1908, during a brief return to England, Freshwater married Nancy (Annie) Swingler, a schoolteacher in Market Harborough. After a honeymoon in Edinburgh, he and his new wife returned to Africa and were stationed in Mporokoso, also in Zambia (then Northern Rodesia), and a first child - Bernard Bruce - was born at Kambole on 28 February 1909. During this tour of duty he was in charge of the Mission Station and was on the District Committee and the Translation Committee. After a brief return to Britain, the family was posted to Kambole in 1913 but when war broke out in 1914 they returned to Mbereshi which was further away from the border with German East Africa (territories which include modern Burundi, Rwanda, and mainland Tanzania) and any hostilities. Freshwater studied the local language - Chibembe - and contributed to the development of Central Africa through the fields of linguistic studies, language and translation, carrying out much work between 1920 and 1925. He participated in the translation of the New Testament into Chibembe. Between 1925 and 1932, he was in charge of the Mission Station at Kafulwe in the Lake Mweru district. After a brief spell in Britain again in 1932-1933, a period of ill-health followed his return to Africa and he collapsed in 1934 after a journey to Capetown. On recovery in Bulawayo, he was placed at Fort Rosebery where he continued with translation work on the Old Testament. However, he had to return to Capetown for an operation and in March 1936 he wrote his last few lines home to relations in Britain from the Andres Murray Missionary Home in Capetown. Will Freshwater died on 25 April 1936 and was buried in the Woltemade No.1 Cemetery, Capetown, South Africa. Nancy Freshwater returned to England in 1938 and died in 1959.

Benjamin Franklin, born in Boston on 17 January 1706, was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, musician, inventor, satirist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He facilitated many civic organizations, including a fire department and a university. He was one of the United States Ministers to France from 1778-1785, and to Sweden from 1782-1783. He had been Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1764, and was the 6th President of Pennsylvania between 1785 and 1788. He had also been the first US Postmaster General. Dr. Benjamin Franklin died in Philadelphia on 17 April 1790. Benjamin Rush was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was born in Philadelphia on 4 January 1746. Rush lived in the state of Pennsylvania and was a physician, writer, educator, humanitarian, as well as the founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He studied at Princeton and at Edinburgh University. Rush signed the Declaration of Independence and attended the Continental Congress. He served as Surgeon General in the Continental army, and was blamed for criticising George Washington. Later in life, Rush became a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Benjamin Rush died in Philadelphia on 19 April 1813. Jonathan Potts was born in Pennsylvania in 1745. He studied at Edinburgh University (its Medical School). He had also studied at the first school of medicine in America, the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1768. He had been in the first graduating class. Dr. Potts was given command of the Fort George General Hospital, the single largest hospital in North America at the time. His efforts returned hundreds of men to the Continental Army at a critical moment in American history. He made a major and substantial contribution to American victory on Lake Champlain in 1776. Dr. Jonathan Potts died in 1781.

Walter Ledermann was born on 18 Mar 1911, the second of William and Charlotte Ledermann's four children, in Berlin, Germany. His Father was a physician, though the family was accustomed to poverty following World War I and the depression of the 1920s. Ledermann was a promising student from an early age, and a keen violinist. He received his leaving certificate from the Leibniz Gymnasium early due to his performance in classics and mathematics, which allowed him to complete his degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Berlin. There he encountered several mathematicians and physicists of note who inspired him, including Issai Schur, Heinz Hopf, Max Plank, and Erwin Shrodinger.  On completion of his degree, it became clear to Ledermann that he could no longer stay in Germany. He won a scholarship created by students at St Andrews to support a Jewish refugee, during which time his brother was working in Edinburgh to gain a medical qualification. Ledermann was awarded his PhD after two years.  Encouraged by Professor Turnbull of St Andrews University, Ledermann sought an interview with Professor Edmund Whittaker (later Sir) at the University of Edinburgh with a view to seeking employment there. Whittaker invited him to come as a visiting student to Edinburgh for one term, offering him a bursary of £50 and encouraging him to attend the lectures of A C Aitken. Aitken quickly became a friend to Ledermann, and introduced him to Godfrey Thomson, Bell Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh, and Director of Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). At that time, Thomson required a mathematical assistant for a Carnegie funded project which would eventually result in the publication of his seminal book, The Factorial Analysis of Human Ability, and he immediately offered Ledermann the post. It is from this period that the majority of Ledermann's papers, which largely comprise of letters from Thomson, were created. Ledermann's work with Thomson was interrupted for 6 months in 1937 when Ledermann accepted a post teaching at the University of Dundee. He returned to work with Thomson in Edinburgh until 1938, when he took a lecturer's post in the University of St Andrews. In 1940, Ledermann's naturalization was completed, and he was also awarded his DSc from the University of Edinburgh. He married his wife, Ruth Ledermann, a social worker, in 1946, later having a son, Jonathon. The couple moved to Manchester, where Ledermann was worked as a lecturer in pure mathematics in the University of Manchester, from 1946-1962.  In 1962 Ledermann gained a lecture post at the new University of Sussex, where he eventually became a professor. He found the atmosphere of the modern university highly stimulating, and taught for two further years past the statutory age of retirement (then 65). Even after his official retirement in 1978, Ledermann continued to give occasional courses and revision classes to his students until 1997, when he and Ruth, by then a psychotherapist, moved to London. Ledermann died in London on 22 May 2009.

James Kirkwood was born in Dunbar, East Lothian, in around 1650. He graduated from Edinburgh University in 1670, and became chaplain to John Campbell, Earl of Caithness, 1st Earl of Breadalbane. In 1679 he became Minister of Minto. Due to the religious turbulence of the period he left Minto in 1681 and went to England, to Astwick, Bedfordshire. In 1690 he was responsible for the circulation of two hundred copies of the Bible in Irish throughout the Highlands, and in 1699 published An overture for founding and maintaining bibliothecks in every paroch throughout the kingdom Kirkwood was an advocate of libraries in every parish throughout the country. James Kirkwood died in 1708.

Willa Muir was born Wilhelmina Johnston Anderson on the Shetland island of Unst in 1890. She was brought up in Montrose, Angus, before studying at St. Andrews - one of the first women to study for a University degree. In 1910, she graduated with a degree in Classics. She became Vice-Principal of a teacher training college in London, but left in 1919 when she married the critic and poet, Edwin Muir (1887-1959) who became one of the central figures of the modern Scottish cultural renaissance. During the First World War years, Willa Muir undertook postgraduate study in psychology and was interested in the then relatively recent work of Freud and Jung into the unconscious mind and the interpretation of dreams. The inter-war years saw the Muirs travelling Europe - the then new Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria and Italy - absorbing developments in European literature and translating more than forty novels, the best known being works of Kafka. The more able linguist of the two, she was probably the main translator in these projects, also translating many books herself, under the name of Agnes Neill Scott.  Willa Muir wrote only two novels: Imagined Corners (1931); and, Mrs Ritchie (1933). Both explored the conventions of small town Scottish life, and the effects of Calvinism, and the limitations experienced by women in these settings. In 1936 she wrote two extended essays: Mrs Grundy in Scotland and Women in Scotland, and these examined the roles open to women in contemporary Scotland. After the death of Edwin Muir, she wrote an account of their life together, Belonging: A Memoir (1968). She also wrote a study of oral poetry, Living with Ballads (1965).  Willa Muir died on 22 May 1970. Vernon Phillips Watkins, born at Maesteg, Glamorgan, on 27 June 1906, was a British poet, translator and painter. He went to Swansea Grammar School, the preparatory school of Tyttenhanger Lodge, Seaford, Sussex, and to Repton School, Derbyshire. He briefly studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, reading French and German, but did not continue, and worked in banking instead. Always, from a very early age, Watkins had been devoted to the English Romantic poets, and he himself emerged as a poet. He would become one of the very few metaphysical poets of the twentieth century and probably the most distinguished. He was a close friend of Dylan Thomas. During the Second World War he served in the R.A.F. Police and in Intelligence (1941-1946). He married a colleague of his from Intelligence in 1944. Watkins lived all his adult life in Gower, and after his marriage he lived at 'The Garth' on Pennard Cliffs. He received many literary prizes, and was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of Wales in 1966 and became a Gulbenkian Scholar at University College, Swansea. Vernon Watkins died in Seattle on 8 October 1967 during his stay as Visiting Professor of Poetry at the University of Washington.

This collection is composed simply of an invitation - dated 6 August 1907 - from the elders, managers and members of the congregation to the Rev. William Dobbie to take up the post of Pastor at Castle Hill United Free Church in Forres, Moray, Scotland. William Dobbie was born on 21 May 1881 in Ayr. He attended Ayr Academy and studied at Glasgow University. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Ayr in May 1906, and assisted at Glasgow Camphill until 1907 when he was ordained and inducted at Castle Hill U. F. Church in Forres, 20 September 1907. Dobbie married Jean Fulton Hamilton on 25 April 1911. In 1914 he translated to Glasgow Govanhill and then did war service with the YMCA in France in 1916. In 1921 he translated to Lanark Cairns. The Rev. William Dobbie died on 30 April 1946. For the origins of Castlehill U. F. Church, we have to look at events of 1733 when the First (or original) Secession saw members leave the Church of Scotland as a protest against the system of Patronage, by which a minister was appointed to a congregation on presentation by a landowner. A congregation was founded in 1768, when a group in Forres joined the Secession Movement. The first church was built at the north end of Batchen Street, Forres. It had various names over time: United Secession; United Presbyterian; and, United Free. The foundation stone of the Castlehill Church was laid on September 22, 1870, and it was opened and dedicated on November 26, 1871, with building costs of £3,000. In 1900, the United Presbyterian and the Free Churches united to form the United Free Church of Scotland. This meant that there were two U.F. Churches in Forres, and each had to take a distinctive name. It was at that point that it was named Castlehill, from the site on which it stood, and the other became the High Church. In 1902 the Town Council presented the freedom of the burgh to Lord Strathcona in Castlehill Church. In 1903 James MacDougall Black became the minister and remained until 1907. Dr Black was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1938-1939. Two outbreaks of dry-rot, in 1902 and in 1946, meant that extensive and expensive work was necessary, and this was paid for by the congregation and by generous donations from Lord and Lady Strathcona and Andrew Carnegie. When the Rev. David Leslie Scott, Minister of Forres Castlehill Church, retired on 30 June 1972 the church was closed and the charge united with Forres High Church under the name of Forres St Leonard's. The former Castlehill Church was sold to the Forres Parish Church of St. Laurence and became its church halls. After a protracted period of refurbishment, it was eventually opened and dedicated on September 5, 1976. Dry-rot however can never be eradicated completely and some thirty years after the last repair the rot had reached such as state that it became beyond the economic means of the congregation of the Parish Church of St. Laurence. The building was finally sold on 30 June 2006, which was 34-years after the building was closed as a church.

Rev Thomas Allan was born on 16 August 1916 in Newmilnes, Ayrshire to William and Agnes. He was educated at Newmilnes Primary School and Kilmarnock Academy before going on to graduate from the University of Glasgow with a first class honours degree in English Literature. In 1945, following a number of years war service in the RAF he entered Trinity Theological College, Glasgow and was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1946.
In 1941 Tom Allan married Jane Moore and they had three children, Margaret Elizabeth, William Thomas and Kenneth John.
Rev Tom Allan's first charge was North Kelvinside Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1953 when he left to join the "Tell Scotland" movement. Tell Scotland started as a result of two Scottish radio missions of the BBC in which leading preachers of several denominations combined in a nation wide evangelistic drive. In 1953 the "Tell Scotland" committee was formed and Rev Tom Allan was appointed evangelistic organiser. He became a key figure in the Scottish evangelical movement of the mid-20th century and travelled extensively throughout Britain in his capacity as evangelist for the Church of Scotland. In 1955 when Billy Graham held his 'All Scotland Crusade', Tom Allan was Chairman of the organizing committee.
In 1955 Rev Tom Allan accepted a call to become minister of St George's-Tron Parish Church in Glasgow and he served here until 1964 when he had to retire on the grounds of ill health. In 1955 Rev Allan held youth rallies at St George's-Tron which proved so popular that accommodation problems were experienced. The services were consequently relayed to churches filled by overflow audiences and by April 1956 five churches were involved and a total of 4,500 tickets were issued on one night.
Following a heart attack in 1964 Tom Allan requested demission (or resignation) from St George's Tron. He later died on the 8th September 1965.

The Museum of Scotland, part of the National Museums of Scotland, was designed by the architects Benson and Forsyth. The firm had been selected as winners of an archictectural competition in 1991. The design received inspiration from Scotland's national building tradition, evoking the idea of castle, broch, tower house, and tenement. Materials used include external cladding of golden Clashach sandstone from Morayshire, and concrete, limestone, beech, and smooth plaster in the interior of the building. A roof-top garden offers views of Edinburgh Castle , Greyfriars Kirk, the Scott Monument, the city skyline generally, the sea, and the hills. The Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, was the first national museum project in the UK since the mid-19th century and it was opened by the Queen in November 1998. Professor Michael Lynch, Edinburgh University, was appointed as a consultant to the Exhibition Review Committee (ERC) which oversaw the planning of the building and the devising of the content.

James Stanley Cavaye was born in 1914. He served as a Councillor in Edinburgh. He was first elected as a Progressive to the old City of Edinburgh Corporation in 1970 and switched to the Conservatives two years later. When local government was reorganised in 1974 he successfully stood as a Tory for both Lothian Regional Council and Edinburgh District Council. His working life was spent in Portobello Power Station, originally run by the municipal Electricity Department, latterly the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Cavaye had been a collector of glass-plate slides for 'magic lantern shows', buying these in the small junk shops that used to be found in Edinburgh's Grassmarket and the West Bow. He found and saved the Begbie Collection of very early glass-plate photographs of Edinburgh. They were found in a flat in St. James Square in 1950. He gifted the plates to the City Arts Centre, Edinburgh, in 1990. The gift is known as the 'Cavaye Collection of Thomas Begbie Plates'. He was a founder and former Chair of the Edinburgh Festival Volunteer Guides Association (set up in 1947) which gave tours of the Royal Mile. He also gave lectures on the history of Edinburgh. Stanley Cavaye died in 2004. He was buried at Liberton Cemetary on Thursday 12 February 2004.

In this lecture, Thomson explores what intelligence is. He discusses the tendency to see intelligence and instinct as separate entities, and why he thinks this is inaccurate; the idea that thinking is simply trial and error using concepts and imagery rather than action; and the correlation between consciousness and intelligence in relation to the flashes of insight that come from the unconscious. He also discusses the work of Spearman, suggesting that Spearman's two factor theory does not adequately represent the complexity of intelligence.

Thomson outlines how individuals make associations between ideas – both logical associations and unique associations which have occurred to the individual by chance – and how this aids memory.  He describes the unique way in which music creates associations; stresses the importance in allowing children to make their own associations, thus encouraging creativity and discovery; and discusses how the lecturer can utilise both associations and generalisations.

William Shepherd Morrison was born on 10 August 1893, one of eight sons of John Morrison of Torinturk, Argyll, and Marion Morrison. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and during his schooling entered the Officers Training Corps (OTC), 1906-1912. He studied Arts and Law at Edinburgh University, beginning in 1912, and continued in the OTC Artillery, 1912-1914. When the First World War broke out, Morrison interrupted his studies and in August 1914 entered the Royal Field Artillery, Special Reserve, as a 2nd Lieutenant. In March 1915 he was wounded at Neuve Chapelle, a British offensive in the Artois region, and in March and June 1915 he was mentioned in Dispatches. In March 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross, and by June 1915 he was a Lieutenant, and September 1916 an Acting Captain. In January 1916 he was again mentioned in Dispatches, and in November 1917 he became a Captain. Once more, in March 1919, he was mentioned in Dispatches. Towards the end of hostilities, he served with the Scottish Command Gas School, 1918-1919. In 1919 he resigned his Commission. Morrison resumed his studies at Edinburgh University and while there was President of the University Union and Senior President of the Students Representative Council. He obtained the degree of M.A. in 1920. In 1923 he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in London. Also in 1923, in December that year, and again in October 1924, in General Elections, he contested for the Unionists in the Western Isles, Scotland, campaigning in Gaelic. In 1924 too, he married Katharine Allison Swan, in Leith. She had also been a graduate of Edinburgh University and she too was reading for the Bar. As far as a political career was concerned, Morrison would not become an MP until 1929 when he won the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, in England, for the Conservatives. He would hold the seat though for some thirty years, until 1959. He became a KC (Kings Council) in 1934, and was appointed recorder of Walsall, Staffordshire, in 1935. He became Financial Secretary to the Treasury later that year. In 1936 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and a member of the Privy Council. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Food in 1939-40, Postmaster-General in 1940-42, and Minister of Town and Country Planning from 1943 until 1945 when his party went into Opposition. By 1951, the year when the Conservatives were returned to power, Morrison was a Bencher (or Master of the Bench) - a senior Inn of Court member - and from October 1951 to 1959 he was Speaker of the House of Commons presiding, for example, over debates on the Suez crisis in 1956. In 1959 he retired from the House and soon afterwards, in November 1959, he was chosen to succeed Sir William (Viscount) Slim as Governor-General of Australia. He was created Viscount Dunrossil of Vallaquie (on the island of North Uist, Outer Hebrides) and appointed G.C.M.G. Morrison had seven brothers: John Morrison, Donald Morrison, Alexander Morrison, Neil Morrison, Donald John Morrison, Cecil John Rhodes Morrison, and Roderick Morrison. In 1965, the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognised the eldest brother, John Morrison of Ruchdi, as chief of clan and name Morrison. Donald Morrison had studied pharmacology and then became a crofter and general merchant in North Uist. Alexander Morrison was a farmer in Canada, but was killed at Loos in 1915. Neil Morrison became a solicitor. Donald John Morrison - called 'Pwe' or 'DJ' - became a GP in Ballantrae, Ayrshire. Cecil John Rhodes Morrison became a doctor, a radiologist, in London. Sadly, Roderick Morrison died in infancy. William Shepherd Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil, died on 3 February 1961 at Government House, Canberra, Australia. After a state funeral, he was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St John the Baptist, Reid, Canberra. His eldest son, John Morrison, succeeded to the viscountcy. His widow, Lady Dunrossil died in England in 1983.

He has added a short post script at the end of his letter the next day stating M S Bartlett's method is best.

Alicia Ann Spottiswoode (Alicia Scott) was born at Spottiswoode House in the Borders (formerly Berwickshire) on 24 June 1810. She was a Scottish songwriter and composer known chiefly for the tune, Annie Laurie, to which the words of a 17th-century poet, William Douglas, were set. She was the oldest daughter of John Spottiswoode of Berwickshire and his wife Helen Wauchope of Niddrie-Mains. On 16 March 1836 she married Lord John Douglas Scott, a younger son of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, and consequently is alternatively known by her courtesy title of Lady John Scott. Lord Scott died in 1860. Lady Scott was a champion of traditional Scots language, history and culture, her motto being 'Haud [hold] fast by the past'. Annie Laurie was published in 1838. Scott died at Spottiswoode on 12 March 1900. Alicia's family home, Spottiswoode House, underwent major rebuilding in 1832-34, and in her poem or song The Lament of the Auld House of Spottiswood, the house humourously chides the laird for desecrating his family's childhood memories.

The University of Malawi opened in 1964-1965 and the academic, poet, writer, journalist, essayist and publisher Professor Steve Bernard Miles Chimombo (b. 1945) had an association with it from 1972 until 2002 when he retired. Chimombo was among the original first known writers from Chancellor College at Zomba near Blantyre, part of the University of Malawi. He was involved in the creative writing magazineOdi. His work includes theNapolo Poemsand the playThe rain-maker. Another early writer at Chancellor College was the poet Jack Mapanje (b. 1944) who had grown up in the newly independent Malawi under the dictatorship of Dr. Hastings Banda. He was a founding member of the Malawi Writers' Group (or Writers Workshop) which was formed in April 1970 in a deliberate attempt to build a Malawian written literature. The Group met weekly at the College and provided its members with a sympathetic audience for their own poems and stories. Through the groups' gatherings they succeeded in avoiding the control of the official government censor. Though the Group was confined to Chancellor College, it attracted contributions from journalists, teachers and businessmen. The Group became the only forum in which Malawian affairs were freely discussed. Mapanje became a Lecturer in English at the College in 1975, and he published his first collection of poems in London in 1981 -Of chameleons and gods. In 1987, by which time he had become Head of the Department of English, he was detained by police acting for Malawi Special Branch and remained in detention at Mikuyu Maximum Security Detention Centre for three and half years without trial. His poems inThe Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison(1993) were composed while he was imprisoned, as well as most of his third collection of poetry,Skipping without Ropes(1998). More recently he taught a degree course at the University of Leeds, 1993-96, in England, and has been teaching as a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at the University of Newcastle also in England.

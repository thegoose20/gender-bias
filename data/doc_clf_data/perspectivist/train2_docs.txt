Christabel Harriette Pankhurst was born in Manchester on 22 September 1880. She was the daughter of lawyer Dr. Richard Pankhurst and women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and sister of Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela Pankhurst. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War. Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst, DBE, died on 13 February 1958.

Albert E. G. Pilliner was born in Glasgow in 1909 but spent much of his childhood in Shrewsbury, where his father worked as an engineer. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury. Although he was accepted by Cambridge University, he was unsuccessful in receiving a scholarship and so went to Birmingham University where he studied Chemistry. On graduating, Pilliner went into teaching. During the Second World War, he was selected for work in a government research facility near Wrexham and there he used his statistical knowledge and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of explosives. It was at this period in his life that Pilliner met William Emmett, another statistician. After the war, he took up teaching again, teaching Chemistry and Physics, and continued to keep in touch with Emmett. It was possibly through this communication that Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson came to hear of Pilliner, because in 1949 he took up a post as lecturer at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). On Thomson's retiral in 1951 and subsequent death in 1955, Pilliner and his colleagues continued Thomson's work within what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment, University of Edinburgh - dubbed Room 70 during Thomson's time. Pilliner took over the running of Room 70 as well as lecturing to the Dip.Ed. and B.Ed. courses for a number of years. In 1961, after a successful research trip to Israel on behalf of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Pilliner was invited to work for the NFER (National Foundation of Educational Research) which he turned down. By the 1970s however, most of his time was spent working as a consultant to the British Council, UNESCO, and other bodies, and he conducted research into the examination systems of many countries including Mauritius, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Albert E. G. Pilliner died in 2003.

Autograph letter signed to the Editor of the Scotsman newspaper, 3 pages 8vo, written at Allerly, Melrose, on writing paper of Edinburgh University, and dated 5 November 1867. The letter, which is either an autograph draft or an edited version prepared for publication, condemns the forgery by Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1880) of letters of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Denis Vrain-Lucas was one of the most notorious forgers of the nineteenth century. His forged letters of Newton and Pascal were sold to one Michel Chasles in 1861. Brewster writes that he is glad to see in the Scotsman the opinions of Professor Kelland and Professor Tait on the letters of Pascal and Newton. The forgery of the letters he writes, 'is proved by every variety of evidence internal, and external, direct and circumstantial, and not a single fact or argument has been produced to prove that they are authentic'.

This letter from Christabel Pankhurst to Mrs. Morrow [Hove], written 23 November 1913, from 11 avenue de la Grande Armee, Paris, discusses fund raising efforts and the appalling condition suffered by imprisoned suffragettes: 'This collection gives to all WSPU members and friends an opportunity to make a united demonstration of the kind which will impress the Government and the public and will prove the utter futility of torture [...] The prisoners are doing their part. It is for the rest of us to do ours and thus to show that the movement is financially as in every other way invincible'.  News clippings which form part of this collection include items relating to the unveiling by Stanley Baldwin - on Thursday 6 March 1930 - of a statue of Mrs. Pankhurst (Emily Pankhurst) in Victoria Tower Gardens (Houses of Parliament), London.

The Corson Collection consists of materials assembled by James Clarkson Corson (1905-1988), Deputy Librarian of Edinburgh University and Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford.It is comprised of two sub-divisions. The first consists of materials related to Sir Walter Scott, including manuscripts, artworks, realia, memorabilia, press-cuttings, and critical materials, which were purposely collected by Corson to complement his extensive collection of printed works by or about Scott.The second consists of Corson's own papers. Most of these are connected to Corson's published and unpublished research on Sir Walter Scott. There are also, however, papers relating to his role as Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford (1952-1988), some personal and family papers, and the papers of critic and broadcaster William Saunders, for whom Corson appears to have acted as literary executor.

No need for conservation, except for possible removal
of one pin. In folder 'Miscellaneous proofs of Songs of the Hebrides, vols. 2 and
3', the proof sheets are very worn and stained, with one pin still remaining. In folder 'Various Marjory Kennedy-Fraser mss., deposited in 1967', the Scots song sheet is ripped in two parts and would need to be repaired. In folder 'Printed music collections', Balakirew's and Stecker's publications are both complete, but badly decayed and fragile, with broken bindings, and would need some conservation as
well as rebinding. In folder 'Kennedy-Fraser Mss. D.18377 [E60/25]',
several of the notation sheets in envelope 'Marjory Kennedy-Fraser music notation
sheets' are worn, some have holes and rust marks from previously removed metal paper fasteners, and a few sheets are about to fall apart – the content of the entire envelope is thus fragile and needs some conservation.
 Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Several pins removed and replaced with plastic clips. Fragile or loose items either protected and supported with acid free sheets and plastic clips or put into separate new archive envelopes. Some items put into separate transparent archive folders for protection. A dirty envelope stored in separate envelope to avoid damage to other items.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters

The copy of the letter is dated 1 April 1882 below the statement that it 'is an exact copy of the copy of the original letter as made by D. Lewis', 1 December 1859.  The original letter was written in London 20 December 1766 by Dr. Benjamin Franklin and was addressed to Dr. Benjamin Rush and Dr. Jonathan Potts. It refers to letters of introduction to several of Franklin's friends in Edinburgh. At the same time he states that 'you will be your own best frtiends if you apply diligently to your studies, refraining from all idle useless amusements'. The letter continues in this vein and then talks of the 'great advantages in going to study at Edinburgh at this time, where there happens to be collected a set of truly great men'.

Between 1943 and 1945, Thompson set about keeping a personal wartime journal hoping to register possible changes to his psychological make-up. The journal offers data on the effects of long-term overseas service amongst officers. The journal is in diary form with 9 volumes, covering the period 18 July 1943 to 15 October 1945, and written while in North Africa, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Austria. Within the diaries are newspaper cuttings of the period, photographs, franked envelopes, and other inserted materials. The collection also includes printed matter in the form of New Zealand Law Reports (1962, 1963), New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, press-cuttings relating to Thompson v. Turbott (1961-1965), and material relating to a Public Service Appeal.

This collection of 3,465 glass positive slides were acquired from the Roslin Institute in November 2009 as part of a larger accession of material. The slides, which range in date from the 1870s to the 1930s, cover a wide range of subjects; photographs of indigenous peoples from around the world, international travel scenes, personal portraits (frequently of figures connected with the natural/veterinary/agricultural sciences), images and portraits of domestic animals (chiefly sheep, poultry, cows and pigs), illustrations and extracts from books, articles and newspapers. The majority of the slides are black and white, although some are hand-coloured or tinted. Many of the slides were produced by T.J. Walls, an optician on Forrest Road, Edinburgh.  It is thought that at least a proportion of the collection was created or collected by James Cossar Ewart as well as Robert Wallace, in their capacities as professors of, respectively, Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, and were probably used for teaching and illustrative purposes. Both Ewart and Wallace appear (separately) in the slides, as do colleagues and other persons known to both or either of the men. While some of the slides appear to be directly associated with Ewart and/or Wallace, it is supposed that a proportion of the collection may have been sent to them by colleagues from around the world. It is not known how the collection ultimately came to reside at the Roslin Institute.

The letter is dated Doncaster, 26 January 1833, and addressed to Lady Campbell / Barcaldine / Bonaw / Argyleshire. It was written when the young Alexander was 13-years old, and begins, 'My dear Mamma'. The letter writes of making amends and promises to 'write much oftener than I have done previously'; of the 'nice cake' sent to him; and, of the receipt of a letter from Margaret who had said that 'Mary went to shower baths every other day'. The letter tells of how Christmas and New Year was spent, with the teenager going to 'Mrs MacDougall's on the Saturday before Christmas' and going to the Cathedral on Christmas Day. In York, he 'heard the Russian Horn band and went to the Circus and was very much amused with the horses'. The letter goes on to ask how the pony is and supposes that 'he has not been rode much since I left home'. Locally they 'have had some frost here lately and had a little sliding and a few attempts to skate'.

Archivist's NoteNone  Grant Buttars 05 May 2003Christabel Harriette Pankhurst was born in Manchester on 22 September 1880. She was the daughter of lawyer Dr. Richard Pankhurst and women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and sister of Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela Pankhurst. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls, and Christabel obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester. She was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. She was jailed again in 1907 and in 1909. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act'. The start of the First World War compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. In prison she engaged in a hunger strike. A truce was declared and Pankhurst spoke out against the danger that Germany offered, and she toured the country making recruitment speeches at which her supporters handed out white feathers (a badge of cowardice) to non-uniformed males, though neither she nor her supporters spoke out for the right of women to march to the front as well. Meanwhile, in Russia, women served in the armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, and their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes After some British women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote at the end of the First World War, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election but was narrowly defeated. Only twenty years after that, British women had the opportunity to join uniformed services. Pankhurst left England in 1921 and moved to the USA where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement. She became active in heralding 'the personal, visible, and powerful Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ as foreshown by the present signs of the times'. She returned to England in the 1930s and was made a Dame in 1936, but again left for the USA at the onset of the Second World War. Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst, DBE, died on 13 February 1958.

She was a great-granddaughter of the Scottish peer Archibald Kennedy (1770-1846), 1st Marquess of Ailsa (also known as Lord Kennedy, and as The Earl of Cassilis). Violet Kennedy-Erskine married Arthur Otway Jacob (d. 1936), an Irish Major in the British Army, on 27 October 1894. She accompanied him to India where he was serving (with the cavalry regiment, the 20th Royal Hussars). The Jacobs had a son, their only child, in 1895, Arthur Henry (Harry) Jacob. He died however as a soldier at the battle of the Somme in 1916, during the First World War, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of Violet Jacob's fiction. In her poetry, she was associated with Scots revivalists. Her Wild Geese from 'Songs of Angus' (1915), takes the form of a conversation between the poet and the North Wind, and is a sad poem of longing for home. Her work spans five decades and includes: a novel, The Sheepstealers (1902); the historical novel Flemington (1911); short stories, Tales of my own country (1922); a history, the Lairds of Dun (1931); and, The Scottish poems of Violet Jacob (1944).

Albert E. G. Pilliner was born in Glasgow in 1909 but spent much of his childhood in Shrewsbury, where his father worked as an engineer. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury. Although he was accepted by Cambridge University, he was unsuccessful in receiving a scholarship and so went to Birmingham University where he studied Chemistry. On graduating, Pilliner went into teaching. During the Second World War, he was selected for work in a government research facility near Wrexham and there he used his statistical knowledge and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of explosives. It was at this period in his life that Pilliner met William Emmett, another statistician. After the war, he took up teaching again, teaching Chemistry and Physics, and continued to keep in touch with Emmett. It was possibly through this communication that Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson came to hear of Pilliner, because in 1949 he took up a post as lecturer at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre (later Moray House College of Education). On Thomson's retiral in 1951 and subsequent death in 1955, Pilliner and his colleagues continued Thomson's work within what became the Godfrey Thomson Unit for Academic Assessment, University of Edinburgh - dubbed Room 70 during Thomson's time. Pilliner took over the running of Room 70 as well as lecturing to the Dip.Ed. and B.Ed. courses for a number of years. In 1961, after a successful research trip to Israel on behalf of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), Pilliner was invited to work for the NFER (National Foundation of Educational Research) which he turned down. By the 1970s however, most of his time was spent working as a consultant to the British Council, UNESCO, and other bodies, and he conducted research into the examination systems of many countries including Mauritius, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Albert E. G. Pilliner died in 2003.

Autograph letter signed to the Editor of the Scotsman newspaper, 3 pages 8vo, written at Allerly, Melrose, on writing paper of Edinburgh University, and dated 5 November 1867. The letter, which is either an autograph draft or an edited version prepared for publication, condemns the forgery by Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1880) of letters of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Denis Vrain-Lucas was one of the most notorious forgers of the nineteenth century. His forged letters of Newton and Pascal were sold to one Michel Chasles in 1861. Brewster writes that he is glad to see in the Scotsman the opinions of Professor Kelland and Professor Tait on the letters of Pascal and Newton. The forgery of the letters he writes, 'is proved by every variety of evidence internal, and external, direct and circumstantial, and not a single fact or argument has been produced to prove that they are authentic'.

This letter from Christabel Pankhurst to Mrs. Morrow [Hove], written 23 November 1913, from 11 avenue de la Grande Armee, Paris, discusses fund raising efforts and the appalling condition suffered by imprisoned suffragettes: 'This collection gives to all WSPU members and friends an opportunity to make a united demonstration of the kind which will impress the Government and the public and will prove the utter futility of torture [...] The prisoners are doing their part. It is for the rest of us to do ours and thus to show that the movement is financially as in every other way invincible'.  News clippings which form part of this collection include items relating to the unveiling by Stanley Baldwin - on Thursday 6 March 1930 - of a statue of Mrs. Pankhurst (Emily Pankhurst) in Victoria Tower Gardens (Houses of Parliament), London.

The Corson Collection consists of materials assembled by James Clarkson Corson (1905-1988), Deputy Librarian of Edinburgh University and Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford.It is comprised of two sub-divisions. The first consists of materials related to Sir Walter Scott, including manuscripts, artworks, realia, memorabilia, press-cuttings, and critical materials, which were purposely collected by Corson to complement his extensive collection of printed works by or about Scott.The second consists of Corson's own papers. Most of these are connected to Corson's published and unpublished research on Sir Walter Scott. There are also, however, papers relating to his role as Honorary Librarian of Abbotsford (1952-1988), some personal and family papers, and the papers of critic and broadcaster William Saunders, for whom Corson appears to have acted as literary executor.

No need for conservation, except for possible removal
of one pin. In folder 'Miscellaneous proofs of Songs of the Hebrides, vols. 2 and
3', the proof sheets are very worn and stained, with one pin still remaining. In folder 'Various Marjory Kennedy-Fraser mss., deposited in 1967', the Scots song sheet is ripped in two parts and would need to be repaired. In folder 'Printed music collections', Balakirew's and Stecker's publications are both complete, but badly decayed and fragile, with broken bindings, and would need some conservation as
well as rebinding. In folder 'Kennedy-Fraser Mss. D.18377 [E60/25]',
several of the notation sheets in envelope 'Marjory Kennedy-Fraser music notation
sheets' are worn, some have holes and rust marks from previously removed metal paper fasteners, and a few sheets are about to fall apart – the content of the entire envelope is thus fragile and needs some conservation.
 Work Done - All items dusted with brush and put into new archive envelopes. Several pins removed and replaced with plastic clips. Fragile or loose items either protected and supported with acid free sheets and plastic clips or put into separate new archive envelopes. Some items put into separate transparent archive folders for protection. A dirty envelope stored in separate envelope to avoid damage to other items.

Scrapbook 'Songs of Scotland – Programmes 1882-6' is in
reasonably fair condition, but cover is missing, binding coming apart,
and index page badly decayed. Furthermore, the glue used to affix
recital programmes and press cuttings has become stiff and slightly
stained the paper, and its impact on the overall status of the
scrapbook ought to be assessed. In folder 'Letters from various
Kennedy siblings, Italy, 1879-80', all letters were already freed from
pins and paper fasteners. Most of the letters, all in ink, are in fair
condition, but the paper used is thin and has become fragile, with
frequent rust marks and holes from the previously removed metal
fasteners; some letters are damaged: torn, stained, or affected by
moisture and/or rodents. The 127 letters are somewhat arbitrarily split
into four bundles: in bundles 'James Kennedy' and 'Robert Kennedy',
they are arranged in chronological order, whereas in bundles 'Marjory,
James, Robert Kennedy' and 'Miscellaneous', they are in no particular
order. Letters in bundle 'Miscellaneous' are still folded, whereas all
other letters were already unfolded. The 96 letters in folder ''Sir
Granville Bantock', D.19228, E61/19', are in fair condition; 94 letters

The copy of the letter is dated 1 April 1882 below the statement that it 'is an exact copy of the copy of the original letter as made by D. Lewis', 1 December 1859.  The original letter was written in London 20 December 1766 by Dr. Benjamin Franklin and was addressed to Dr. Benjamin Rush and Dr. Jonathan Potts. It refers to letters of introduction to several of Franklin's friends in Edinburgh. At the same time he states that 'you will be your own best frtiends if you apply diligently to your studies, refraining from all idle useless amusements'. The letter continues in this vein and then talks of the 'great advantages in going to study at Edinburgh at this time, where there happens to be collected a set of truly great men'.

Between 1943 and 1945, Thompson set about keeping a personal wartime journal hoping to register possible changes to his psychological make-up. The journal offers data on the effects of long-term overseas service amongst officers. The journal is in diary form with 9 volumes, covering the period 18 July 1943 to 15 October 1945, and written while in North Africa, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Austria. Within the diaries are newspaper cuttings of the period, photographs, franked envelopes, and other inserted materials. The collection also includes printed matter in the form of New Zealand Law Reports (1962, 1963), New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, press-cuttings relating to Thompson v. Turbott (1961-1965), and material relating to a Public Service Appeal.

This collection of 3,465 glass positive slides were acquired from the Roslin Institute in November 2009 as part of a larger accession of material. The slides, which range in date from the 1870s to the 1930s, cover a wide range of subjects; photographs of indigenous peoples from around the world, international travel scenes, personal portraits (frequently of figures connected with the natural/veterinary/agricultural sciences), images and portraits of domestic animals (chiefly sheep, poultry, cows and pigs), illustrations and extracts from books, articles and newspapers. The majority of the slides are black and white, although some are hand-coloured or tinted. Many of the slides were produced by T.J. Walls, an optician on Forrest Road, Edinburgh.  It is thought that at least a proportion of the collection was created or collected by James Cossar Ewart as well as Robert Wallace, in their capacities as professors of, respectively, Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, and were probably used for teaching and illustrative purposes. Both Ewart and Wallace appear (separately) in the slides, as do colleagues and other persons known to both or either of the men. While some of the slides appear to be directly associated with Ewart and/or Wallace, it is supposed that a proportion of the collection may have been sent to them by colleagues from around the world. It is not known how the collection ultimately came to reside at the Roslin Institute.

The letter is dated Doncaster, 26 January 1833, and addressed to Lady Campbell / Barcaldine / Bonaw / Argyleshire. It was written when the young Alexander was 13-years old, and begins, 'My dear Mamma'. The letter writes of making amends and promises to 'write much oftener than I have done previously'; of the 'nice cake' sent to him; and, of the receipt of a letter from Margaret who had said that 'Mary went to shower baths every other day'. The letter tells of how Christmas and New Year was spent, with the teenager going to 'Mrs MacDougall's on the Saturday before Christmas' and going to the Cathedral on Christmas Day. In York, he 'heard the Russian Horn band and went to the Circus and was very much amused with the horses'. The letter goes on to ask how the pony is and supposes that 'he has not been rode much since I left home'. Locally they 'have had some frost here lately and had a little sliding and a few attempts to skate'.
